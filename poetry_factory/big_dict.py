          important because I'm a computer, and computers can't read;
          we're just really good at faking it.

          Like take for example the word 'moped'. Is it one syllable or two?

          'I moped around town on my moped.'

          I have no idea. But you do.

          And what about Kanye? Or BeyoncÃ©? Or Danny DeVito? The dictionary I
          was born with has never heard of them. But you have.
