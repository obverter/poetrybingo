<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

<!-- Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `obverter`, `tmz-poetry`, `obverter`, `BenTylerElliott`, `obverter.com`, `ben`, `TMZ Poetry`, `Turning Trash Into Treasure` -->

Generally speaking, recycling is important. So is reusing. But reducing...?

When it comes to art, reducing is only desirable within a project's bounds.

> <cite>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni</cite>

Once TMZ headlines have been out in the world for a day or three, they tend to fade from the zeitgeist. This is a shame.

And so I built this thing, which:

1. Automatically scrapes TMZ's main blogroll every five minutes. ‚úÖ
2. Appends new headlines to a monster, forever-updating csv. (`headlines.csv` descending by timestamp) ‚úÖ
3. Uses those headlines to train a handwritten grammar in spaCy. üî®
4. Generates poetry from the headline corpus. üî®
5. Overlays said poetry onto images scraped from Wikimedia Commons üî®

You're welcome.

<!-- ## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->

### Play around with my work

First, you'll need to clone the repo. Follow these instructions carefully.

1. Navigate to somewhere amazing on your machine.
   ```sh

   ```
2. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/obverter/tmz-poetry.git
   ```
3. Ensure that your machine and this repo are codependent.
   ```sh
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Split the atom.
   ```sh
   $ jupyter notebook
   ```

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If my analyses or work seem fundamentally wrong and/or are yucking your yum, let me know why! Projects are never finished; only abandoned. I'm always looking to improve.

Don't forget to give the project a star! And then make a burner account and give it another star! Thanks again!
