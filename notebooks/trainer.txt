Delicate savage You'll never hold the cinder But still you will burn A splash and a cry Words pulled from the riverside Dryed in the hot sun Steamy, mist rising Rocks receiving downward crash As the jungle weeps You were broken glass But I touched you even though I knew it would hurt Eyes dance with firelight The Moon and I are lovers The spiteful sun dies I woke up today I wanted to write a song I wrote a haiku Know when to quit, friend No time to waste in this space Live well to the end Gazing upon plains A loving wind warms my nose The sun behind me The lion limped out And flipped his tail at March when Fleecy frolicked in Your words are wounding Your tongue, a bloody scalpel Your aim, perfection Empty bleeding womb Stark white faces, sad eyes say Sorry for your loss It ebbs and flows now My will a rock in the swell I sink beneath it Finally they're gone My chaotic family Now peace and silence Tragication, it seemed Erawakening it was, though Happiness will come Always doomscrolling Very stressful times indeed Need someone to lead? Care must be taken Risk always necessary Treasuring the needle I just need some time For rest and healing and change I'll get better soon Trump is really bad He will end America World War Three is real She was so broken He pieced her back together And broke her himself My first day of cake What a fabulous feeling Another blue cheese Real roses have thorns They teach appreciation Without holding on All the bees and trees Won't even briefly lament? Human extinction I can float away In the deep dark, abyss Welcomed by the stars My mind betrays me Each night by dreaming of him Nowhere left to run Washing the dishes Thinking about a haiku Words flow like water Waves roll west to east Observed by October trees Reechoes of a crow Dark room and moonlight Fingers reek of nicotine Another cold night Take a look through me I'm essentially empty Man, the breathing husk She lifts her ass high Where she looks, her gaze demands Sprink me harder, please Clatcher of bottles And the dense breath of a man She prays for daylight Smoke drifts, doubt aside Opportunity in hand Another face plant Small steps to healing Years of damage to repair I am in no rush I lay here in bed My thoughts full of fear and dread I wish I were dead Light or dark inside Songbirds sing in the sunshine Owens glide true at night It strange how you can Surround yourself with people Yet still feel alone In one swift movement A heron swallows a fish And then flies away White sands on the beach And pink petals off a branch Drifting in the wind [Sacraments]Your gift Opened, they have all I need Your love so perfect My cheeks are sandy Square pants star lives under rock Alaskan bull worm I wish to send you A video of a crow Sucks for you, I'm blocked No one dies today Not inside my influence And not on my watch The calm river flows Branchs lurch in the waters [Rivers] Tell the tale Live your fantasies Your dreams can be memories Just stay out of jail What we leave behind? Is how we are remembered? Plastic is garbage You were turned over Rainbow, sheened world's floating free Your bnbbles poured out I met a poacher Asked him why he liked to kill Just kidding, shot him Hopelessly, naive Pining'til the crack of dawn My bell never rings Progress is all gone I gave into my vices Time to start over My grief counselor Was excellent and just died I don't feel a thing Constant time For how slow everyday feels This year ended quick In love with Bundy Death just around the corner [Laugh] In the sea Why is it so hard? Just to get a job right now Paying living wage Foot in a puddle A forgotten parking lot Good place to daydream Bifurcated hams Just jack off my fag penis Unresolve the straight one Normally I'd sleep But sleeping won't save me now Not from this heartbreak I just kissed a grill Had to prove that I'm not gay Shit, I'm gunna puke Listen, she's breathless Look into her bloodshot eyes Should I let go yet? The river bed was Throwing off the cover and? Breaked the winter quilt Seething emotions Churning thoughts, feelings askew All I blurt is hi Will we reconnect? Positive thoughts ensure it We will reconnect I searched north to south Despondency was my spoils Rescued by your smile A peaceful sunrise Discovers the idle streets The drunkard blinded A secluded place 'Always away from all else I long to live in The empty ink pen So lonely on my dresser Begs me to use it Rob really did it A new city, a new job Two holes in the ground It has betrayed me Heart pumping eyes wide awake Sleep, I summon thee Hidden strength built up From years of struggle and pain You are now mighty Get rid of your junk And you will finally have Room for your treasure This shit just got real A big promotion ahead It's mine if I want I look for shelter And find a new hiding place Under the pines Two unsteady feet Steel themselves for another Failed attempt to fly One on one time, wow? Each moment so close, perfect Once again, Lord, thanks Mercury poisoned The kid went to therapy And misdiagnosed Frost on the river All boats have been pulled in tight Chicks are home to roost A battered housewife Hidden out in her kitchen Prepares tempura Loolly braided stems A dainty crown for a queen Small yellow stained hands When you told me that You had three fewer children Who was sacrificed? I run far away Nothing but the essentials Keeping my friends safe People's dilemma In the last breath of freedom Thunderous applause An ancient city Silent sands consume his name Ozymandias Sometimes it's just there Like a lead weight on your chest Compounding your soul Whet in the garden Gentle squeeze of the trigger Death of the Haiku No real purpose here Where is my life going now? Fuck, I want to die Shade of a tall tree Becoming a welcoming breeze Breath, tranquility Clear was your anger Strange how I prayed for you Find the love you seek I cannot think straight I feel alone completely Irreparable I love you so much You are the best on the earth Daddy, I love you She's a burrito Always getting stuffed so full Get it, she cucks me Howling wind rattles? The broken summer awning That broke from the wind I dreamt I was dead A dark curtain between sides I was asleep, right? Three in the morning Times ticking by as I scroll I'm craving for sleep Fallas hangin'out Be my homosexual Just don't tell my wife Googling symptoms Turns computer off, pours wine No cure for the blues She's an outdoor cat Reminiscing her fifth life Illuminating moon Defenses are high Positions deeply entrenched Fighting with my boss She makes that cough like Pirates on the horizon Already too late Window cracked open Hoping for fresh morning air Smells like skunk butt now Dead men sing no songs But smart conspirators know Silence is a note A son of lightning Roots run deep beneath my feet Peapers, bleached, clear white Life is still quite sweet Even in times of sadness Let me breathe again Is it possible? To distill out the spaces And leave just the time Bounds in the wall now Where pretty things used to be? You are still with me Just as gray clouds burst And light rains whisper downward I yawn contently The weekend was packed Now back to work tomorrow My life has not slowed In the neighborhood Signs divide the red and blue Will this ever end? Fighting a typhoon Relieved, I press on, but I can't stand the rain This haiku was born While Huckleberry gummies Swam in my belly Have not been outside Since early February Summer days, please stay A flower blossoms Uncurls its naked petals Pours in the sun, crunch I should have proposed You look stunning in your gown Always be happy This still feels like home I have been gone for nine years Time to leave again Knock, knock on the door Little monsters with blue claws Digging for candy? Morose until I Make my soul sing a song back Will you forget me? Scurry lurking bird This sugar is not your life Do not be tempted Wrong, faded and stained The rag dries the artist's brush It lives its purpose Full journal pages Returned to cover yesterday Where do the days go? A single note plays The tune linked with piano Push the middle C I believe in me Yet I stand in my own way I will carry on A landscape pastiche Smears of blue, green and yellow Monet dreamed for me Coins shook from her hair In a midas touch with the Leaves changing to gold Fatherhood issues Peed out diaper late at night Have another drink Social networking A soapbox for everyone Can we survive it? My head is burnt out With all this context switching Try again later Never connected Nothing makes one feel alone Like that admission Winter's breath so cold Numbing fingers inside gloves And ears under hats Am I getting one? Asked a man in Antucket Or just giving one Holding on too long Is just fear of letting go? I can't release you The writing removed No body bags to be seen Death of the Haiku Feating my demons Spiritual redemption Freedom to be me Be kind to yourself Not just in the present, but Past and future too My glass is empty The bathroom tap will not do Kitchen tastes better The shine of the moon And the glimmer of the stars Damn mortality Haiku is an art Painting, landscape, dreams of gold For minds to behold [Message read loud] Clear Words embrace repulse hard work In these jobless times This was a pit stop A temporary refuge You were good to me Oprahilous July Smothering, sweaty sleepers Distinct thunder mocks If this peace is real Let me collect my thoughts quick Then all life is fake I love you, she says Resting her hand on his heart Afraid he'll wake up Here I lie awake Wanting to sleep and thinking?

Only where I am going Or where I have been When we were still young Before the net ensnared us Days were long and free I wake in the night Stretch, roll over, reach out and Hug your cold pillow Last light of the day The sky so full of colours Peacefulness inside Quick, call the police The peasants are revolting And not just the smell Sing to me, my sweet Dress your infidelity Such beautiful lies Morning light washed field Young, viridian dew glows Appaloosa Wild Complete confidence Power so overwhelming Take on anything You are my whole world Shining star that guides me home Across the vacuum Let's cross the whole world In parallel lines like the Shadows that, abstain Clouds, rain and sun shines Rain means sorrow, sun means joy Today, joyful rain A brush of my face Rays cast by the clear blue sky Cool air fills my lungs My date stood me up I should be mad, but I'm not I don't even care You pull me back in Now these confused emotions Will be my death march Two drunks get hammered They lead each other to doom Can either be blamed My lonely shadow Spreads his body on the walls And the room combusts I do not know what Is shaking my soul the most?

Family or friend Dundeons and dragons Reality fades away My friends and I play Bounce encouragement Satan in the waiting room Weep in the stretcher So many options? An easy way out for sure Just hard to fit through Just outside of town On a dark and lonely road Lost and found of life I am the reaper Without me, the world would rot Still, they want me gone The Bulrush curtsy In the wake of the lagoon While the houses sleep My first recession Retail stores furlough thousands Glad I own no stock Sea and salt and stone Caress me raw and screaming Loving me to death Growing starvation A willy in the White House Enjoying the game Cutting and frying (Cannions based) meat melodies While the veggies soar Hi there, Philip Glass Please, can you play the same thing?

Lips turn up, forced smile What other choice did I have? I am fine, thank you I speak to the stars About my deepest secrets When will they speak back? Do not give new names To historic and sacred Pilgrim, remember? You wake up alone Go throughout your day alone Fall asleep alone We met in the spring Fall in love in the summer And died in winter Halloween retreats Christmas on the horizon But first thanksgiving Cold winter fingers Wrapped in a down comforter Sleep creeps through the house Spring games with the moon Playing hide and seek all night I've never won once A song of sorrow Yet promises a great truth Twenty one pilots Spirits of my past Ink'd across my page of life A tattoo of guilt Pet insecticide Cat chases roach round the room That bug met his doom The weekend is here Now is the time to relax Oh, wait, it's Monday From out of the woods A young dog seeks his master Are we not both lost? Dashing through the snow Ho ho ho ho, he yells aloud Fat drunk, homeless man A mother struggles In silence, she pleas for help But silence she finds Eating taco bell I will punish my toilet No regrets today Up the interstate A plunge to make your skin blue Home before midnight Slowly at first glance Then suddenly all at once Like the sunrise, love The first amendment Does not apply to hate speech? Unless you hate trump Snow goes wherever The wind says wind says to go North, the snow goes south Crazy in this cell Should I be scared of my voice? Or just the echo We both saw the spark A chance to make light for us But the darkness stayed Over indulgence Wincing at patchy flashbacks Fuck, I do that for The sad truth of life All that is good is fleeting We are slaves to time I miss you so much It's so hard without you here Papa, please come back Visiting this place Memories are tangible I still see your face Tears form in my eyes You touch all the right places While I beg, please don't Sunshine on my face Words and chords in melody A rare breath of life Celebrate the day Of a Roman's beheading By sending candy Leapeds learned again Wisdom to grow more, more, more An ultimate form One chance to explain And the monster you run from? Will quickly be slain My life of service In my bucket, love of you Hearing to God each day I see your eyes shine Does your mouth smile wide for me? O to laugh with you Mistakes:Don't look back Learn from them, change, grow and love How can I serve you? Some say love is true Some say love is all you need I just want a glimpse Two big empty hearts A good day to stay in bed A room filled with us The roots of tall trees Rise up from the earthen floor Reclaiming their home The autumn wind blows Her face, numb and heart broken He never showed up Face in your pillow It once meant something to you Now it's just for rent I came to know you But only biblically Not how it matters Shut up, Mama, Gump It's more like TV channels Not chocolate boxes The cold wind blows hard Against a weak little plant Uprooting it all Let the vengeful sky Loose silver arrows of rain On my umbrella Cold covered in snow My heart slows for a moment Until I see you Don't worry, you'll say That is how it always ends Like I know it will Tattered plastic bag Ribboned across barbed wire Anger carves up skin A botched waste of time Days sink like stones in water Muted clock hands wane Another whiskey Darkness, calm, cool, soothing grip Never waking up Thousand miles apart Two souls searched for a meaning They found each other The groundhog had not Seem his mischievous shadow Why is it snowing? Often we have loved Ever bound body spirit? Journey United The light flickers low There is no night for these dreams Or bed to sleep in A god shakes his head A child cries for his mother Still just as empty The blackbird calls out His soft song, gentle and sad He is calling her Watercolour lights Illume the sleeping city As whippoorwills mourn To kindergarten I googled the difference Between duck and goose I love you so much That I would enjoy burning Just to be your light Someone called the cops So they all got off the bus Wonder what they did Me myself and I What the fuck do I do now?

Dark and oppressive Thunder echoing away Lightning, clouds, no rain Strange green oozing puss Boy, this haiku is sure gross Good thing, it's so short I took out the trash And left the confines of home An exciting day A slice and a cut A terrible self hatred Washed away with tears Wake with a numb arm Feel as the blood flows back in Know that you're alive I guess I like you You can do wierd things to me I guess I don't care Suicidal thoughts Worry it all out with vodka [Wheel rinse] Repeat What is now to do?

She brightens my night The only limits Constraining my destiny Are the ones I make? I can see you now For just what you really are I'm glad you are gone Pills booze, broken glass Hear birds chirping but alas They can seize the day Your tears,now my tears Love shared for so many years Hold me tight, my love I think of success Yet all I see is failure What do I do next? Dizzying these heights Your arm around my shoulder I'm glad that it's you Goddess, give me strength The burning times are nearing Giggy little flames A long vacation Most left unpaid and hungry Yet no border wall There I found myself On the edge of the water As I drink deeply As we grow older We must be mindful to love Deep open and free Nothing he can do To make me want him as much As how I want you Water trickles down Garden of many colours See them all year round Softly spoken words Fail to reach your covered ears Shall I scream them then? But you'd be surprised The epiphanies you find In another's life The rain falls gently Last weekend's snow is washed clean More snow on the way Lost soul wandering A good place to stop tonight Not there, idiot Fadly I acted You taught me well, and it shows Wonderful, are we? I needed to poop I made it to the toilet A moment too late Anniversary If only she was still here Unfillable void A moment's silence A brief reflection of life Found in death's sadness Just stop it, would you? I want to be free of that Apple cart stirrer In armour and veil Her view of the world is grim Lest her guard dissolves Happy treason day Corrupted, rotting country Celebrate nothing At work, I am asked Where do we go for lunch time? A great mystery Night falls on a field Lights flicker like stars above Fireflies dance with grace Mid life, Miasma Veering into the slow pain Complex diagram Northern lights calling Will I ever get to see? Beauty in person Live on CNN Very unprofessional So close, watch your step A footprint in mud Is it at all permanent? Shall it fade away? This crushing ordeal Is testing my limits but? What if it's a gift? It is a war crime To destroy cultural sites Instead of humans Been outside a lot Now I have a mask tan line A strange two tone face After a harsh wind Maples take off their red garb Exposeding true form Rising from the earth Pushing upward, falling back We wave hi and bye Set me free tonight For a moment I'll forget This reality Here it comes again I can think of nothing worse Money in the bank To climb Mt Juji More than once or not even Is my biggest fear? Reflect on the past My sorrow leaves it's slumber Eternal drowning The hills rolling by And his scent fills the cabin Swift brush on my leg Breezing in for lunch Crispy potato salad And swallowing sand Ever just listen? Splash up sounds of summer rain Pursuing your spirit Ballons overhead Villagers scamper about Animal crossing And I dreamt I died But with time to drive around And say my goodbyes My misery craves A leave from my company Yet it lacks courage Consensus inverts The logic of rational Decision making This is abhorrent Ziploc bag brimming with pills That is malpractice Plans interrupted Your needs I serviced today Love is all it took There is a relief Knowing the limb brought no loss Squid nor octopus The Kaiju appears Behold humanity's end King of the monsters For a whirlybird The singular resolve is Exalting humans Sweet with brown sugar Peaches and cream or berries Quaker, oats is King How sweet is your voice? A timbre stamped on my soul Love within each word You have cast your pearls Are too beautiful for swine They don't understand Fast ships run tight lines Through the bellowing breakers No time for the sea Time eases some hurt You will be happy again Slowly and surely Lay back and relax Kissing everywhere I love I want to taste you Ray's hit my window Living under quarantine? Longing for outside On a day of thanks Warm wishes to a neighbor Positive and bright I had a baby Actually, my wife did It's cramping my style Cold like winter wind They played me and betrayed me Trust broken, no hope Putting others first They are taught that you come last Not your place in life Sunrise in your mind Illuminating your dreams May it never set? CIS men point fingers Telling me their conclusions Without listening Sun is out schorching Cooking eggs on the pavement True playas only Called in the plumber When I observed his buttocks Got quite excited Good old Monday booze Lending Tuesday's happiness Good old Monday, Blues Wake up to shouting How do I turn down the noise? Sleep in your hallway I wasted my life Marching ahead for nothing Now I'm in prison Flurry of vile words And now I'm at a crossroad Do I stay or go? How can I thank you?

Failure is the start A vague gesture at Feelings may not give meaning But satisfaction Warm and tender thighs Juice on my chin like raindrops K F C Bucket Fireflies in the night Little sparks moving about So peaceful to watch God, I am humbled Amazing by you filled with grace Ever thanking you? Inside I'm screaming No sounds will I make out loud Silence must endure Head is filled with bees Bee's waiting to be released Release lies ahead I can see sunshine I want to live forever Please stay better days A chorus of frogs Peeping out their springtime in A soprano bog This old photograph The last remaining vestige Of a long lost love (sigh) and giggle merge New adventure in her eyes A dotted life note I saw a hunter On election day, we were Civil, how bout that? I cannot count sheep No matter how hard I try There will be no sleep Silence, chokes and kills Much like broken promises She was good at that You were in a dream I saw your warm smile again Why did I wake up? A new sensation Electrical connection To the universe Warrior spirit Lost among technology Where pens become swords? I will not be told Who to love or whom to hate? I'll marry a man You changed your gender My feelings remain the same I still hate your guts Silver Moonlight falls Through the heat of summer night Landing on bare skin But you always thought She would never betray you And yet here we are Temple of the dog Before you an offering Come out for kibble We may starve to death But at least we won't run out Of toilet paper Tears run down my cheeks Emotions bubbling up Like a soda can Why is it this close?

Work, sleep, work again Hobbies cannot be pursued This cycle won't end Ambient waves beat Slow rhythms to tease the gulls My tea is too sweet Really, quite tired Two episodes till the end Alas tomorrow A shift in the winds Whisp'ring of vernal colors But only outside Crying in the night A child, I cannot comfort Spare her heart, take mine Walking through tall grass I squat to relieve myself This really tickles Unbeknownst to you A friendly face cares deeply Don't disappoint them Sorry, no kapish Is ok I no English? We ate in silence Put your clothes back on And let's call this what it is Emotions stay here He passes the time He pursues fruitless efforts He blames time passing Yearning thick as tar The mind womb for bliss and pain Days escape like breath Liquid orange bright Lights, the now clear sky, purple Then comes Navy night God's perfect vigil How imperfect my vigil? Lord, help me this day A man can find joy With anyone so long as? He does not love her The F train and I Like myself, it goes nowhere And does it slowly? Oh, this ritual Your desires manifest If you are worthy If you have to ask Then you are prob the ass hole Spare us the stranger That shiny new purse With babysitting money And a ride from Mom I would have thought that An elephant in the room Would get talked about A flower remains Despite of its surroundings Admire its beauty That gem, Iceberg flip Cleaned to your married finger It has since melted Cry into the sand Tight washes away the pain Reverended A life so lonely A vaguely polite gesture Brings tears to your eyes The night fate stepped in I was sleeping in the woods Suddenly a text Tiny box of love Went so it can't be stolen But I lost the key In deepest void Badly broken and battered No light shall shine here Another haiku Running out of ideas Someone please help me Words seen'love hidden' Today reveal, celebrate Why not just do it? [Laughing Children Play] So quickly, the years have passed Born just yesterday Some of these, I write Some are written by others All of them, I mean Wisteria hangs Intersection of beauty And foreboding doom Under open doors Something about forgetting Tethered to new sights Understandably I rise to work in morning But hesitantly Broken it in millions Shinto gets all together Kintsugi brings life (Slight chill) in the air Fall always brings thoughts of you Come and keep me warm The smell of coffee Sooths the soul of this poor boy The moon knew and smiled Gentle rain breezes Cools the day and warms my heart Carried into dreams The past is dying Space is being created Now fill it with joy I feel so sadly I want to tell him badly I love him madly Constant strain Inspiration as I push Then I flush it down You can beat a dead Horse to water, but you can't Look it in the mouth Today at the Pond A duck held its breath quite long I counted thirty What a happy place That treehouse cabin was great Bed breakfast and bark A dream to believe I can never let go now Fantasy is real Let this rain cleanse me Put out the fire within A new day will dawn You killed them all dead You just downright blew their minds Encore mi amore Bacon on my plate Hell, yeah, to cholesterol Crispy perfection Dark of night undone Lightning scars a velvet sky I wait for the sound Little cuckoo calls Clear sound air feeling lovely This day is quiet Music softly floats Subduing utter silence I drift off to sleep Dropped spear, Rusted shield Hollow eyes in a bronze face Time was the true foe The flies are buzzing Simpletons looking for light The moon miles away The moonlight delights Finch's dancing within beams Peacefully happy Horror read in Braille Something sinister coming I can just feel it Young sprout filled with hope Yearns for sun bends to forces Poor deformed Bonsai I did eat a bug Why did I do it, oh no?

Had we never met? An unexpected Mouth was used today, I Will not forget you Rain colliding now In my window softly A beautiful song Silky smoke rises From the deep urn of wisdom My dreams come to life Waters darkly, gleam And sirens in the moonlight Fleeting as a dream Lungs fill with fresh air Smells crawl on the morning grass Where I want to be All day I refresh That damn tracking history Where is my package? Sun past its highest Awareness returns to me Scrolling commences Oh, you do not care Just sit around, do nothing Mister, panda bear Happened long ago Happened not so long ago Don't ever look back Good conversation Good tunes too, just one question Who the hell are you? You cannot escape Truth is penetrating all Failure is futile Before you ramble If you can't read my silence Then you are nothing Worrying in Dharma A raft making itself known Why bother grasping? Life is just talking In between depression, naps I hurt constantly Lone tree old, but strong Lightning struck mercilessly In flames, still standing Why do I deceive? Those that want the best for me Will I ever change? It is so damn cold My hood is cute but useless Ears are icicles Feel like such a waste Potential never fulfilled Will things turn around? Infinitively drifting A leaf in the clear river Forever afloat There was no glimmer Or sparkle on her anklet Except surveillance Clicks of the pipette Many hundreds and a smell Of bacteria Your love makes me itch Others may touch the same skin No one else can scratch Amber waves of grain Gentle rustle from kind breeze The meadows, Harp sings Darkening mornings Summer's humid air lingers A gentle dispute Society is Three days of toilet paper Away from chaos The tortoise wanders As silent as its shadow Under the noon sun The fifth brightest star In a constellation shines With just enough light There is no more love You don't talk and shut me out She was my kid too Raindrops are quite wet They often fall from the sky Now my car is clean Divert, confuse blind Not the way I want to walk A constant battle What is my purpose? To love and serve as he does Following the lamb I need your help now You say wait till tomorrow I say fuck waiting Current government Privatizing profit and Socializing debt No more excuses They get in the way of goals Get up and do it Surrounded by art I feel uncomfortable How do I create?

Sweat drips on the floor Working in the blazing sun Books and bed, call me Rain falls from the sky Your head tilts up to catch it A bird flies over My dog lies sleeping At my feet, her gentle snores A comfort blanket Forging inner strength The demon beast known as doubt Decapitated Consternational Unkonventionality Exogenisis I make many jokes revealing my true nature Knock, knock who is there? Yesterday left me You are beautiful today Maybe tomorrow Summer grew a straw Spring grew one more, stood through fall In winter, one fell As for unvoiced love Is it too forward of me? To feel it at all Auxures and embers Ghosts of trees that warmed my bones The hills are bare now Dove floating on wind With grace, elegance and peace Nope, just a napkin How can one person? Think they exist, but solely For their own pleasure When you took your life You took part of my life too Oh, how I hate you An old tarnished key Sits on the emptied house steps But yet you still knock Slow, steady breathing There is someone beside me No more lonely nights Pursuation of progress Dedication, it's own skill Patient, persevere Never gaze too long The grips of the dark abyss Relentess as time Can you explain why? Housing is so expensive In the USA Food on the table Each and every meal time We celebrate death At the break of dawn Dew drops, slide slowly on grass The land awakens Friends taken too soon The world is worse without them Ah, but life goes on Mellow rimmed with salt People bustle all around Waves against my shore That place is outside We huddled under a quilt Disaster it and kiss I still remember How we kissed passionately? But where are you now? Like a calm haiku Focus is my mind flowing I have work to do The false friend stalks you The snake constantly deceives Crush them underfoot No sprinkles, just plain Last doughnut in the break room Monday morning, Blues She counted her worth Not by those she helped or loved But pounds and measures Thanksgiving dinner Please don't bring up politics Warm, mashed potatoes Shadows run between Autumn sun sets lower now The forest lays dark Cold dew this morning Tea and conversation helps Off to work, he goes There are memories They only live on in me All of you have gone Should I delete it? Nobody's upvoting it My daily haiku How to get the most? Upvotes for writing haiku Maybe Google knows So those of you that? Exercise at home daily What is your secret? Neither here nor there Continually searching thin air It flows around me Hello, reddittors I'm new to Haiku, so please Give me some advice Final reflection A life which has not blossomed A premature end A stack of breakfast Pour some syrup on there, too Let's get some pancakes I wish in my youth I were told all life's secrets But would I listen? To take your own life Never knowing your own life Is a life unlived? Why this way, my Lord? Why can I not understand? I choose to trust you Your wife was murdered Why treat me like a suspect? You're draped in her will Lawnmower growling Bright sun cresting cloudless sky Cityscape baking Ease between sheets Rain drumming on the tin roof Nature's Lullaby Coyote, Sunset Sky goes from purple to pink Mesa silhouettes Seagulls are soaring Unseen currents overhead Cries of freedom found There is a silence Stillness underneath the noise Aware of itself Wonder if I've met? Something special in your texts Love in infancy The alarms sound off I sleep with one eye open How did you get in? 'Sale in the dark Trying to solve my problems Maybe I'll just smile I'm felling depressed Wish I could hug someone now I miss all my friends A breath of jasmine Remembers the rain just past? And sunshine to come Of all things that kill You choose self deprecation I like you for you At the break of dawn A content spider takes rest In flower petals Terrence McKenna Your words have opened my eyes And therefore my eye Call me your savior I will breathe life into you You will swim again I have decided To be a haiku writer I'm not very good OK, I replied Receiving the lie you told I love you too, babe A's m r eh Tingle and mingle my brain Better than cocaine From what great away? Has this rain drop come today? To land on my cheek Gray skies in the east Watching them is not enough I have things to do Eyes are on the prize Focus is unrelenting Today is the day A chance to explain My poorly guessed intentions Missing I had my own life Until you showed up in it Now I want to share Hidden day owls hoot An old man told me of you Unexpected joy I like how you taste I'm going to savour this Until I regret My life is haiku Just five, seven and five things And it is Haiku Skyes paved in concrete While tail lights paint, the snow red Geese, take the fast lane Literally took The words right out of my mouth Give them back, you thief Sit along edges Pressed against my bed's corners A pure restlessness Too bad I cannot Post pictures to truly show Meaning beyond words You asked to help me? I refusedsoon I was lost Will I ever learn? Ants on the table Dirty laundry on the floor I need to clean up I don't even know Why I keep playing this game? I lost long ago The extent of breath Energy flows throughout me The balance restored A dark night closes And as I open my eyes Bugs sing good morning A beautiful day Shivering despite the sun Cold as loneliness My plate'always full Called to love and servealways I do it for you I should be working On my homework due tonight But I'd rather not Singing songs of love I sit by the river bank Waiting for a boat? Night turns to morning Reason and logic long gone Damn this lizard brain Rain on the windows Takeout chopsticks and the couch Late night paradise A chorus of frogs Are peeping out spring notes in? A soprano bog Ageing is funny We find new ways to fuck up As we go along The bed depresses Is it the mattress or me? Either way, I sink It went the wrong way The water chose for my lungs I started coughing It's like a nicked vein Blooding unable to stop Iron mixed with salt There are only six You heard me six taco bells? In all of Japan Sun on my shoulders A walk with mother nature Fresh air clears the mind A disconnection A block of time that is gone Will I ever know? Your words like daggers Wielded with such precision Invisible wounds Blooding though, uncut Internal wounds never healed Now I love the pain When I walk with you I want to fall into you And touch all of you Humorous spring unfolds The fair little tree hangs on Tiny mountain walls Art confined to dust No capacity for change Death of the Haiku Anthony Bourdain Ultimately lost the fight What chance do I have? I should feel fainter Surely I've lost enough blood This hole in my heart Tell me your burden I will toss mine to the ground To help carry yours Small blue bits, gray clouds Long lost dreams gone, sand grains fall Three more shots today Just two waves joining [Climating] Chaos, ocean Then peaceful once more Secluded alone Humanities meaning lost I have become death We turn from the sun And the trees withdraw their sap Small lives are ending Open, honest, fresh Love filled each moment with you Again is my hope Poor effort, you say The rules don't apply to me The Haiku rebel Northeast and northwest Never shall they meet, they say We defied the rules I smoke weed daily Puff puff pass, it is so dank Oh, shit, my pipe broke No wind for the sail All the world yet to be had Birds have all the luck The daily drive home A scenic and gorgeous view Puffy valleys and hills But you'd be surprised The epiphanies you'd find In another's life I'm just waiting here You promised me forever Now I am alone If the good die young Then why am I still alive? Is it'cause I'm bad? Here is a haiku That I wrote this afternoon About a haiku No clear path ahead Take control with quarantine Ensure your wellbeing Gilding a goldfinch Perched within a budding tree He unties her scarf I wish I cared less I wish that I could forget Erase my sadness Somewhere over the Rainbow way up high there's A Land that I heard of A plane in the sky Gone with nothing left behind Is everyone lost? The fight that broke us In bed, we lay quietly Her hand grabs for mine Are you serious? I'm not somebody, you know Clearly red flags Huddle cuddle dance From my heart flows rhythm to Symbiotic friends Made for you, am I? In your presence ever joy Ever praise and thanks Thoughts on death today Teach me strength for tomorrow My time begins now Grandiosity Incredible verbosity mediocrity Grey January Sentinel Evergreens stand No wind to sway with I drove to my hike Anticipating nature Sign said it was closed The world is busy You tried to stop me today Instead, I rushed past Rolling thunder booms The heavens refresh the earth Again comes the sun Reaching for a hand My fingers catch only air I pull myself up Gonesome Horizon Sun emerges from the trees Elation of birds TV addiction Watching way too many shows Must break this habit She's so dangerous Just kidding, she's quite boring Predictable, too Branch's sway gently Her movements are small and brisk The fan purrs gently A silent contest Of public restroom strangers Who scrubs hands longest? Delicious, golden The quantity of apples The shallow waters Existential pain Nihilistic dilemmas A day in my life A cool gust of wind Kid running with untied shoes I guess Fall is near What must be done now? To succeed later in life Price of admission The heart of the home For contemplating flat screens And mantle remotes I will quit this thing Pour me beer instead of gin Tomorrow, perhaps Deep connectedness A search lasting a lifetime You are not alone Tried to write Haiku But can't think of one right now Try again later Drying tears, leaving Tracks of salty sorrow and Enough winter nights Advent has ended Now to celebrate your love Soul embraced with joy A bird nests above It guards it's young from all threats I hit my head hard Memory of you Your smell lingers on my coat Illusions of you Water washed me clean Spirit filled my soul this day Seventy years back Carnations blossomed Vibrational colors changed through time Now wilting beauties Pestilence Resort Moisterias are returning On buzzing jet skies Chapter Two begins All codes revealed by nature Things on each new moon The sea carved the stone Polished smooth, it has no cracks But no other shape Serendipity It just clicks and you know it The missing piece fits Encased in static I struggle and beg to be Functional again Started at your garden Through the window of your church At your funeral Death knocks at my door He is who he says he is No light for proud men Away from the beach Still lost in the blue ocean Such marvelous eyes First summer raindrops A tadpole stirs in the murk Hope springs eternal Few things left to do Spring spent in isolation Guess I'll write Haiku Mothers are a waste Alcoholic rage on me Finally, find peace Slavery is wrong According to Westerners Who fund slave labor? A dog's loud barking The bark of the forest trees One jarring one still It's great, although tough I made it for you special It's made of your heart Lightning spans the night Each a shard of light, but in Tandemon A Phoenix I was shaken down A dying used autumn leaf Trampled under feet Six in the evening My eyes yearning to meet his Puppy love on screen A cold, starless night Solvestation gives no solace When does the sun rise? Let me be honest I'm honestly here for this Same from the get go Guess I made you up Precautionful pretender of love You never got it Eyes lock souls, collide Passion becomes tangible Through you, I am home Looking up, I cry Gazing back, you embrace me Understanding love The quiet is good That's what my therapist says Let's just enjoy it I wish you could see All that you have done to me I am dead inside I know that you woke To find a cold, empty bed 'Sale once again Chairs turned to the south Take a seat now, run and jump Dimples from laughter Thunder and evening Set in on a dark valley Rainstorms then ensue Back in my dorm room I left my dildo in the Refrigerator Ran out a week back Started using shower head Send toilet paper Dairy cows are raped Children torn from their mothers So you can eat cheese? My days are numbered Yet my life still feels empty Just like this, Haiku The fast moving clouds Restrained below scorching sun To give me respite Fout demons of hell Said the brave man with gusto They did not stir once If you see someone Who looks like they need a friend? Be that friend to them Dreamed of a haiku In which was the word Haiku Can't remember it Back in custody Department of Erections I love prison, Cock In her voice, sorrow I wish I could help somehow Distance restricts me A merry, go round That horse is inanimate Blogging up and down This is my poem Now it is nearly finished Haiku very much The hairy creature With its dry, craggy brown tongue Seems a water source The silent snow falls Winter wraps a cold embrace Spring promises life Pale winter sunset Worrying under soggy clouds Fira soaks the bed It took me too long To notice, I wrote Haiku For the wrong person A flock of starlings In mindblowing formations Birds can be awesome Always in my mind I wrote about you today My love, Symphony The lonely ostrich Sits atop Yellow Mountain And waits for ice cream Got into trouble Somehow made it out alive Rebels never die Fields of red poppies Lives cut down and strewn around Lest we forget them? Octavio Paz I silently start to read My soul seeks some peace To say I like you Discourse so complicated Humans interact The roar of the falls And time spent falling asleep What it takes to jump? Summer's almost here Robin's fly north seems like it Never went away I yearn to be brave Fear drowns me and takes over Breath and try again Peacefully, I go Worried in a sea of faces Lungs filled with small talk Answer lost to time Who allowed canines egress? Has a catchy tune Out of comfort zone Trusting in your grace, my Lord Prayer for wisdom She's got work early And I get to sleep in late Colder without her Should I clean my room? It's not that dirty it can Wait, how old am I? Unfathomable Her love is for her children Gift of God indeed Crossing open sea Sewing with a strong night wind Guided by the stars Our thoughts and prayers Then we will just go along Like nothing happened I want to be good For whatever that is worth I love everyone Perfectly colored Maneuvered nails, blue and red Dressed for the party Good taste in humor Something I need to learn still My jokes are selfish A truth like water Flusts through cracks in your story Discovers its shape Roses from the grove In the kitchen they wait for The breeze, the silence I change my colors Just like a chameleon Always unhappy A building pressure An ecstasy unrivalled The turd releases Grinning dulcet tones I hope that ambient noise Fucking destroys you Building a ladder Rungs upon rungs, lace two stalks Climbing and growing You mean to tell me? This could have been an email And no one brought snacks My scars have opened Old marks are bleeding anew Burn with memories Plutonian seoul Hubble could barely see it Kuiper ships waiting This has me thinking Can all the haiku's be summed? With mathematics The long winter melt Awakens Desert Flora Like a cold shower Past a reflection Of what future can become? Do we dare look back? A teasing solstice Unveileding her limbs with the Leaves fluttering off Haikus are like drugs Once you start, you cannot stop Somebody help me Gazing at the sky Sticked dreaming of tomorrow Motionless today Knock, knock who is there? A jester looking for laughs Merriment for all Let me seek some rest This is endless exhaustion There has to be help Adrift in the sea Fish overhead like rockets Calm inside the storm Someone comforting Wrapped in your arms and your love There I feel at home It has been a year Guess we are not meant to be Shit, I still love you Need to catch my breath This is drowning me too deep Have to get out now Dear Jon of Eden If words healed, broken bodies You'd be a doctor Is it a mirror? Your eyes are gazing into Or is it the void? I long for the warmth Of a forgotten embrace I miss you, my love Babbling water Tiny crashes of droplets Shiny pebbles watch In my heart's dungeon Through the bars of my rib cage I held a heart beat You were a mistake Before I even made you I can't fix you now So very tired Will my thoughts please let me rest? Sleep, take me away A tree will live through Millions of years to see that Man is arrogant 'Everyone I am Wading through frigid butter Only you can melt Man yields prejudice Violence breeds violence Eden sank to grief Blades of grass flutter Violently in the wind But still their roots hold Two bodies in bed A brief contact in the dark Moist and I My energy spent I slip into exhaustion Please let me have rest Darting back to bed Your warm body against mine Just five more minutes Good morning, Bonsai Time for a haircut, just a Little off the top Low rumbles within Growing louder, sweating now Where's the toilet, please? I breathe and gasp drenched With earthy scents, I must pause For Monsoon is here This is not a phase The future here is so bleak My heart now is black Army of seedlings Designed for the hoop houses Ready for planting Trees dance with the wind Shades of green make your heart swell Water slakes the ground Deep wheeze I breathe in Cough and cough to no avail For I am the phlegm Back in the office Desk plant survived without me Life will find a way The tone of the wind 'String the voice of the rain' How luxurious? The echoes of screams Passing winds and waving trees The mind is at peace Pow the champagne flows An outburst of emotions Bubbles mix with blood For I am now banned No longer shall I subscribe? Askreddit goodbye Kids think they know more Now they see less, but know more Their youth is no more Soft, intermittent Light flickers between petals Pursuing, troubled mind With no umbrella We ran the rest of the way Such a smelly dog Wind whips through my soul Snows, howl and blow in hatred It's too freaking cold Sand beneath my feet Sun gazing over the sea Now, summer is here Warm, sunshine, cold breeze ( visible signs)hidden love Smiles reveal the source I give you my thanks But good, sir, what you just said? Sorry, I hate it Creaking steps announce The approach of my best friend Paws on hardwood stairs As free as a bird Those feathers will never swim What are your limits? Write haikus for moms 'Cause mom's like nice things too, but Have no time to read The heat grew stronger As I moved closer to her I welcomed the burn I feel in despair So atypical of me Where is my hope now? I am drinking wine My wife left me and the kids Everything is fine Fryid winter stalks Frozens, puddles, stiffens, trees They crack like knuckles Night falls on dark skies Shines as black takes stars dim fate The absence of day Masturbation time I think of terrible things Making my cock hurt The hope that you lit Elluminated my world If only briefly Two ducks glide across Turtle Pond Their Wake Trails merge Together as one I told her my dreams She told me I was selfish I'm devastated Warmness flows around me Cold bitterness flows inside I love shower beer Sundown, the trees bleed The view from behind haunts me Yet keeps me enticed Nice amount of snow Varied backyard jungle gym February sky No one really dies Guess we were never alive Just dead memories I may get the job They called for an interview I need all your prayers My heart it cries out Please just call me your darling So I can feel loved Forced words don't flow true As those that pour from my heart And live on the page Cold air fills my lungs My being is all I know I hear the grass grow I shot a pigeon With it's dying breath, it said Cheep, Cheep, Cheep, Cheep, squawk As dark turns to light The rotation of the earth Good morning, Songbird My house is cluttered Like my mind with memories That I cannot clean The swells had grown and Mal de Mar was heaved into The pitchpoling lake Hairstyle tried at home Some things are best left to pros Now I must wear hats I wish we were brave Pillars of candid discourse I am not that free Rough moustache bristles ' lightly tickle my anus I nut too quickly One too many beers We need a proctologist Sack of cucumbers Grace in each moment Eyes on God is all I need To see perfect love I own four ferrets Lou Blue, Frankie and Freya My sun shines for them Yaking squirrels stretch Flowers, spray, deodorant Is it spring time yet? His break as a kid Predicts the forecast with A Barometer bone All the time you need I'm hardly being patient I don't care at all A map, a compass Even with these things I can't Find my place in you I am so sorry We were never meant to be So you disappeared? I wrote you again I still await your response I still await you My sock seam pokes me I keep fidgeting in bed But find no comfort The future seems bleak The present is challenging Living in the past I just got gut punch Now my pants are full of crap Plowed it down his throat Thoughts flow through my mind Feelings arise in my mind Actor Waking Up! Who are we to be? It is we who should decide Not what's on TV Camera ready Capturing reality Photography fun During a lecture Notes are typed in a flurry I'm eager to learn A beautiful soul Comes from the most damaged heart For Newton's third law Purpose of passion At expense of survival To love what you do You touch me deeply Each mark shaping who I am Ever loving you? Erased from her thoughts The men in black don't come back She stares in silence A rainy Sunday My migrane will pass too late Staring at myself Hard to love you, friend Prayerful for the help I need To remove this fence Warm spring evening breeze Suns, sweet rays on face and buds A leaf grows here now Even while I am Gazing at the horizon I still think of her My days overfilled Your love gets me through it, Lord All my trust in you It is so peaceful Under the warm, blocky sun Minecraft is lovely Hate online dating Infinite swiping and typing Can't make it work Fear fades from thy sight Like spring snow on quiet night You are alive now Dying fish don't bounce Just watching blue seeing through Wondering what counts? Meaningful haikus Makes you think about your life's Biggest hopes and fears Apart for too long Distance is the real problem And an easy fix Glistening blue eyes Her warming smile thaws my heart Do I take the leap? Below snow capped peak An ice swollen stream growing Rebirth shoots appear The animal laughs You can't keep it in control No, nut November I miss you, my friend Let me share my troubled mind No one else gets me Trial and error Failure is nothing to fear Here we go again Sometimes I think that Everyone in the world is Gay, except for me Time races forward Another month approaches As we ignore doom My dearest nation I will fly like an eagle To be free of thee My feelings, they hurt A hug right now would be nice I miss you, come back New ice cream maker How did you land at good will? Probably a breakup Let peace be with us Always constant, never gone A little boy's dream A real detective Yellow and adorable Searching for the truth As the stars slide by And the years gather their pace My love keeps growing Lonely, sad young girl I'll be your bosom friend too Anne of Green gables In a pond of ice Lotus, spirits, sleep and dream Of spring's arrival The sky had reset The air started to darken My head low, I cried I sent a haiku To a poetry contest Please give me your votes No satisfaction Desires satiated The trap of Mara Such uncertainty If this is to leave, then leave Colour falls from trees Smoke, piggybacks, wind Glittering just like the sea Sunrise is witnessed Time with you, priceless Your smile and words fabulous Such a memory Ding your name pops up Not my problem anymore Quickly deleted Looking in your eyes I know that I am ready You're the one for me New growth quickly blooms Only to be whisked away By winter's cold wind Spike into my arms The stench of plague is here, son You will be safe here Positive outlook It will get better someday Need to live for now Cat with the beanies Paws are so soft and fluffy It makes me happy The trees are alive They tell só many stories Close your eyes, listen Now that work is done I celebrate by mowing The overgrown lawn Each being a mulch With a spirit seed sleeping Spike, reach for the sun Killing them softly Pretty flowers in the field (Neagles) In their arm Measured steps through snow A thousand memories fall Melching in the spring Shitty, short poem Thanks for letting me hide my Quiet, ugly thoughts My blood donation Transported in the woods by Red Cross mosquitoes Life is wonderful My room, my clothes and my bag Smell like falafel Chating on my phone Like I have nothing to do Just to talk with you A familiar voice Blowing music through the pines Stands there silently Atlantic Plumbing The secret life of cables Designing a whale? Attracted chaos Respawned copious adventures Left minds in Maelstrom Thirty five years old Slow suicide by bottle My only brother I am in a daze The streets and people have changed Why must this be so? I need to let go Do I do this on my own? Or wait for your help Love does not disperse It flows freely and transforms All that it touches A tree fell today Its roots crawled from underground It was once human Yearning for a time Eternally naive when Leaves begin to fall I also write raps Play with my words, I be like Haikus can be trap Salty breeze, skims, waves The auburn orb slowly melts Sea and sand hold hands Why do you frogs croak? You are keeping me awake I'm calling the cops Coast Guard, sailing south Thunder over providence [Brants] Huddle ahead Bonsai in the pot Beauty and Moss all over Sowbug, take a walk Scooching hot summer Sandlot baseball, baby Ruth Now run for your life Humanity bleeds Forever and unchanging Yet we refuse death The depths of the night Hidden thoughts rise from Bellow A long night indeed The students argue Each their case for blue or red Then wind up in bed So when I awoke? I cleared my eyes, then my mind Awaken, I saw you School feels like torture Debt amps pressure to succeed All to become slaves You're totally lost A strange region on the web Off the beaten path The storm took them all The blank earth waits in silence Only clouds remain Lotterie winner People exploit loneliness Picking at my bones? [Puzzleing] In my head Aaching from within the brain I wish for a nap In a world falling I am losing my footing Can my mind hold on? Dig into deep blue It's soothing and refreshing Clean, body and mind Which is which we say No question before you ask In this perfect tao Sometimes we fall down It's often hilarious Except when it's me Hey, do you have milk? White gold from Bovine allies My breakfast is wet Poor service today Turned to another with hope Can you forgive me? Porcelona Fingers Trace Hearts on Faked Bedsheets Wishing they were skin Does this still ring true? Am I a sand dune or man? I embrace the sand A leaf falls from branch The beginning of the end The world dies with it Oh, dear Mother Earth My, oh, my, she suffers so Just to punish us Strict, alcoholic A light, bright fog remembers At the perfect bridge Full suitcase, all packed If I only had the dough I'd still do nothing A little closer Be a little quieter The gentlest touch Crude truths, silky lies We each have a favourite And one we despise There is a ladder This ladder has no ending Why not stop climbing? Took a little stroll To the corners of my mind Found my dusty self This summer morning Cutting through a thousand trees The screech from a hawk They fell deep in love Under the full moon one night After their first kiss A summer cooler Abrusally awakened for Their winter fortress Soft breeze filled the air Melancholic mood sets in It started to rain Fresh air and sunshine A relaxed morning with friends Breakfast with the birds Coffee and cigar Cool breeze blows birds, chirp bees buzz Summer vacation A fresh first, sweet sip Cleans my messy morning mind Oolong gong fu cha? I try to grasp you I pull yet, you slip away Damn stupid nose hair Oh, how wonderful The path beneath the tree tops While the spring rain talks Your way before me How I need help to walk it? Each step forward, please Temple bells die out The fragrant blossoms remain A perfect evening Hearts beat together Closer with each new second Train over green fields When women tell you Chivalry is dead, just say Those are some nice tits I am ecstatic The twilight force have returned Life has meaning now Waning gibbous moon I reflect upon my age And the paths I took You can't rush Haiku Hurry the fuck up, Haiku! Turns out I was wrong A leaf has one life A destined life, no escape Best lived in sunlight What do I do now? Fori do not understand Please, someone help me Watching dishes dry What's the word I'm looking for? Procrastination Blue skies swallowed up The darkness encroaches me Snakes surround my feet Whoa is what I said? Booty, an amazing view While she gives me head Lost numb gelid blood God pours holy kerosene Warmness seized her that night Sharp eyes, spot movement Salmon, glisten, shallow stream Is their future safe? I can't remember The days when you cared for me I miss your embrace Relief starts to come Paid in tears and words with friends Hope begins again Growing before you Has been awkward and painful I might be done soon Little winter birds Chattering amongst themselves Outside my window Isolated here Far grime, family and friends Afuser is smart Long years, my colleague A part of every word Molar for the tongs If the planet Earth Was one big cultural site Would there be no war? All the bees and trees Won't lament even briefly? Human extinction My candle has died The dull, slow burning incense Is all I have left? The angel's cold tears Call for the land's protector But no one answers In the open fields The blind scarecrow keeps close watch Standing not in vain Cold, use your pockets But Daddy, they're full with what Fast cars and mittens Unlocking the doors A thief had stolen in and Stole Paradise! Painting your portrait I gyrate my hips and howl Canvas remains blank Alien, I am Anunnaki, Deity Won't they abduct me? A salty winter Forecasting a salty spring Sweeping off the snacks Freezed travelers Welcome, a warm companion No cream or sugar Reaching for the sun But only grabbing sunlight Nice try, Icarus I cut my own hair Reporting for duty, sir Too damn short again Grass is so grassy Grass is also very green The grass is shiny You gotta be safe You're in charge of your own health Just keep your distance A perfect surprise Success instead of setback Prayer answered,'love' Two, oh, one seven We laughed, cried, loved, lived and served Next passcatch the ring Brief exuberance Purple, Jacaranda tears Paint the old footpath Fireworks fill the sky And the excited children Watch television I like most women Plum, sweet and begging for cream Thank you very much Her eyes are wet coins Too many they're drowning me I hope she leaves soon Twisted thorn branches Look over my desert seat My puddle of shade The burden of life Thrusted upon all who's born To live or not to Mind fog, heart racing Anxious, not aware of cause Offormed dosage woes Pain as my pleasure Cold, hard steel, thrust to my heart The final climax She screamed out, oh, God I know she's an atheist She must not hate this You cry for the storm? You cringe and curse the thunder Yet you run outside I'm not listening I screamed, jumping in the pool Just drowning you out Each wave casts shadows On the next repeating Us from memory A hushed droning din Distinct keys, clack and phones ring A belly rumbles I claw my chest out Inside, I hope to find her But just a dead bird It feels so hopeless They don't believe I can fly I will prove them wrong Candy canes are good Candy canes can be sharpened Use it as a shank Alone afloat I'm Dead to you and to myself You never loved me Pretty little girl You say while I smile sweetly? Plotting your murder Words inside my mind Always be true to yourself Advice to myself Low rumbles within Growing louder, sweating now Where's the damn toilet? Your sacrifices For all you love remembered Thanks, happy birthday Follow him around As he's talking on the phone Feeling like dead weight? Eating frozen grapes? Blue polyester bathrobe Last daydreams, then bed Mental health is a Solitary prison cell Or a bubble popped Imagined roadblock Addressed quickly, cleared sunshine Take my hand, let's walk Closed curtains, small bed Slogging subreddits all night A brand new cake day enduring the pain Of the needle stabbing her For beauty not seen A flower of love Stretching toward the sunlight Held fast by its roots One billion flashlights Shine down from the winter sky Over sleeping tents In each moment, you Then I see you more clearly Perfect is your love And here you stand tall Gaze into the dark abyss Step into the void The magic is gone Faded heart burnt to a crisp The old days are gone The nurse nurtures wounds A spy takes reconnaissance Hunter stalks its prey The ultimate scare As earthquakes make mountains shake History repeats Still water at night Deceptively dangerous Stagnated silence I've written love songs For somebody in this world Who has yet to come? Natasha Lyonne Is her spirit animal? I really like that Bluffs awoken Carried by wind and water My eyes float with them A violinist Plays soft, tranquil melodies On strings of catgut She's hot and I'm dumb It's a tale as old as time Here we go again Exchanging glances Sips of laughter and little Private sins we own Sitting in traffic Holy shit, I have to pee Pass me that bottle Misty blue rainfall Your droplets sing a white song I sleep well tonight A kindred spirit A soul I met in Reddit Tells me not to quit Take what you need to To have what it is you want None of it matters Coming and going Whichever way the wind blows? Journey's end unknown I miss Las Vegas The hotels, the awesome pools Darn you dinkleberg? Seven, five, seven Or was it five, seven, five? Subreddit help me Living alone now? Either the days go by quick Or way too slowly There once was a man From Antucket, but he moved Now he lives elsewhere My entire life Supposed dreams in the nighttime Morning approaches Plucked up the courage Spot the girl, ask her out now Can't she's on the phone? Words of defiance Prayerful, your dreams are pleasant Loved you always It's impossible To kiss your rosy red lips Without getting hurt Wind howling outside I'm snug under warm blankets My cat purrs softly The fragile blossoms Flutter about the spring winds The fragrance so strong I can't stand that bloke Peacocking with the red shirt It's the same as mine Heavy, what is it? The stuff that dreams are made of The Maltese Falcon A night on the town The Tuxedo Cat's suit is Ironed on asphalt As diseases go Alcoholism is great Rollicking good time The road to success Lise behind a mountain of Unspoken failures What is happiness? An empty stream coursing through A bottomless well Rainbows fill the sky Begone rain and flood and muck Now the work begins I'm overthinking Just trying to stay afloat But it's not easy A six word story Seven middle syllables Crap wrong, Subreddit Lying on your back Under the shining leaves Summer luxury I'm slowly drowning But there is no one who cares Just let it happen Two parallel lives Running the same hectic race Never to converge Love can be a harsh Reminding of who we are A bruise on my face Watching time fly by How can someone endure this? Sadness engulfs me I have dreams in life But I don't have the money To obtain my goals Life can be funny Without really meaning to It led me to you How much have we changed? How much have we stayed the same? My pens tell stories Counting syllables First five, then seven, then five Again, it's Haiku A brush of the hand Just passers by in the street That's where it began Sky hazed with thick smoke Hard to breathe, itch, scratch and sneeze Reminisce on spring My dog is near me I'm under a warm blanket Ccosy winter night Eyes closed silently A calm breeze drifts through the air Fate bones seek rest I'm a mindless drone It's all out of my control I apologise The conquering teams Are waving their pompoms in? Dandelion Poofs A place of safety Where I can be my true self From a stressful world Ghosts of the Living Scare and sadden me the most Lively, not living I want to wake up To do that, I need to sleep Am I not asleep? I lie here alone I wish I had someone here My usual night I'm a baby bird Just kidding I'm a human Haha, caw caw caw caw? Pale afternoon sun Wavers behind endless clouds Her wet cough returns Coiled inside my head Never have I felt so close Giving up on hope Poker face laundry Concentrating on their cards The loser will fold To my dirtbag, ex I'm not going to call you Rather get Covid A heavy heart sleeps Are these true or false feelings? Only time will tell Not unlike magic Beautiful beings of light Beleuchtung Memory's like sand And endless waves crash ashore Erasing footprints I rise out of bed The sun fills the open room I smell the new day Love is eternal Pain is just temporary Strength sprouts from ashes Unquestionably I do love you forever Thank you, my father Not suicidal I just find death alluring I won't let them down Do not trust robots They were programmed by humans Instructions unclear Reading Haiku book A bug crawls across the page I blow it away Mellifluously Women in the garden sing Vehemently strong Snowfall on fencing Softening the sentence by Blanking the barbs Child as my mirror You reflect my deepest fears I see hope in you The bay at low tide First ospreys of the season Rebuilding their nest Trusting in God's plan It is always the best plan Free to love and serve An old tarnished key Rusts in the stone house's door Yet you keep knocking When che guevara? Opened a massage parlour He called it cherubs My mind on repeat Like an old broken record Singing Disturbation Trick or treat, mister I hunker down with lights off Platom, my reward A breath of fresh air Surrounded by a culture Immersed from within The virus riots Deaths of legends and fires This year's a decade Without any friends Time moves slower than you think It becomes endless Okay, I admit I am committed to you There's nobody else You're a spun yoyo At the end of her fingers But what can you do? I wait for my time Curled up and kneeling alone Death understands me Perched atop a branch The bird sways with the soft breeze Windsurfing in place Cutting edge neon Flashing into your weak eyes The future is bright Wind blows through the trees Do they have some memory? Or just one moment Now I bide my time Tomorrow can wait for me Today is all mine Little house sparrow You cheerful morning person? What is your secret? I cared a lot once And it ruined me so now I don't care at all Fresh, hot and sticky You tasted like Ambrosia I lapped it all up Little did he know?

Exodia won Trees shrivel from drought The clouds crawl over to weep A red apple drops Accept the hard truth Scrolling is the new smoking And there is no cure Sex sells, but I buy Expression of my true self Addiction, no lie Old cat tells new cat Paw at the round, shiny things This Christmas tree's fun Sun and winding hills He drove, I played online chess Long relaxing drive We had it all wrong Death is really sweet relief From contemplation You don't have to fix All the mistakes you have made Only learn from them Coronavirus Coronavirus, it sucks Coronavirus Hit my messy head Until everything just falls In the right place Don't throw stones at me Or the Mermaids will get you Where is the hallway? Days blur together The unending solitude Keeps me company Thaw my bitter heart Fuck me like the world's ending Make me forget him My brain is broken I can't function normally I'm always sorry You're not on my mind I don't think about you, but Your voice is in it Lizzie Borden stopped And felt her mother's love, but Evil consumed her Don't want to forget A single moment of time We spent together The sea otters float Holding hands in the water Dreaming of oysters? Now to forever Lost her ghost in this forest Trees watch silently Tainted memories Running circles in my head Could they at least walk? You are like the moon An immense forbidden fruit I wish to possess Powder falls from sky Death emerges from it's crypt A new cycle starts A knock on the door But there is nobody home Nobody at all Take me to worship I have come for deathless death Feed me blissful lies Finite bodies ache Shouldering the vast weight of Perpetuality Loved when you are born Nothingness you shall return Time to eat some corn Religious people Jumping through the mental hoops You must be athletes My hands are so clean Unless I touch my glasses Did I eat bacon? The Ashen sky comes I wonder if it will rain I need that soft touch Scrutinizing stares From the ones you thought would care Makes you feel so bare We are just debris In an abyss found somewhere But at least we're found If you hear the birds In the morning as you wake I hope you made it Strong arms hold her tight She screams and fights her captor In the mental ward Just see how we choke On the words which we wish we Had never spoken Anger can consume White hot lava soon to cool Sadness just lingers Ye olde winter shoppe For February, flakes and [licking] icicles Forever silence The moon lights up the night sky I am not alone Piper always paid The final breath still humming It plays us off stage When I lay in bed There's no escape from Storm Clouds In my hollow head Excusement hits hard The Rescue Squad fundraiser Chicken B&BQ? Trampoline at Dusk Ludiculous feet and bouncing hair Sunsets on repeat Morning mushroom dew A deer slips into the mist My dog halts ears up Maths is so boring Derivate's integrals All over my head Her clickety shoes Had men stealing glances at? Their disappointment I love ranch dressing But too much is never good My salad's ruined We breath the same air I fell in love with a ghost You're my afterlife In April we wait From the sky falls the snow flake Sun, come out once more Time slipping away Final rest after sun sets Sleeping without grief Intro music plays Last time on Dragon Ball, Z Kamehameha Today I lost you I feel cold and empty now Because I loved you Scooching desert wind Gerudo King's reject fate Lock up, harsh power I have lived this life Questioning my existence Hope someone listened The day shall soon break Rest while the night is still young Eat bug tomorrow I feel the warm sun I hear the calm ocean waves Summer has begun Tree misses its leaves Yet today the grass is green My coat hangs unused The rain was salty As it ran cold by my lips Fused with my own tears Blue, then grey, then black All through a two by two square I miss the wonder Petting the kitty Hand runs slowly through soft fur Mister, Kitty Purrs Rain drenching the ground Sacrifice begins to creep in Remind overtakes Who talks in Haikus? Writes them online on their phone But not to their spouse Split like old timber No stock left this December Slow fading, ember I need whiskey and Your eyes are the same colour I'll get drunk on them Hide crying in sun Scroll an endless contact list Alone and heavy Village idiot No problem unless it is A global village I am not prepared Going into this last fight Hold onto my hand He'll frozen over A distro by Microsoft Torvalds the victor My mind is worried Cruel snakes inside my place Questions never end Twelve bucks in the bank Loan application denied No one buys my nudes That there is no love I learn eventually Such an idiot Decorum decor I and I alone decide She proudly declared Early kitchen light And early morning coffee Quiet dogs and plants I look through the bars On the rusted iron door See her head resting Sun Rays are always Falling around the desert? It makes my face warm I tried to call you No answer, only voice mail Your voice made me smile Haikus start my day Sometimes blue and sometimes grey But always the same Surging through my veins Who said that Tupac was dead? Music frees his soul Sunshine, hidden well Miserry rains upon us Looking through the gloom The past cannot change You don't owe them what remains Honor their love, live Spring, summer, autumn Winter, spring, summer, autumn Winter spring summer Slow as a glacier Extinction level event We the internet Post men, post women Delivering packages Spreading the disease I lay here awake My eyes glued to the ceiling Damn insomnia A pregnant drop hangs Between this and the patter Love and life are lost My train rumbles past An empty baseball di'mond Kids kiss near first base Thank God for sweat pants All day eating frozen foods From my air fryer Surrounded by grass The silence is delicate So vast yet so full I don't like Haikus I mean, they don't even rhyme Like seriously Have a book to read Thousand emotions arise All in a page, Bind You're always around I can't get a break from you Just get the fuck out Let's get Lyrical May be more satirical Brain so whimsical Will never forget Although I probably should Brighter times ahead The hills are rolling Nature is so beautiful The grass is flowing Iceberg memories Break away on currents of DeMension floes Christmas time is here Time to wrap a hundred gifts Will I get any? Green Garden bucket Half full of yesterday's rain Frogs at home, croaking Ass red like baboon Sumpf ass apocalypse now Gimme that goldbond Growth is always earned A fool wanders aimlessly Plan action reflect Blue flowers, red thorns Donkey, where is the princess? Get out of my swamp Please donate money I'm homeless, sir, please don't leave But why what's a simp? Somebody like you There is no one quite like you I only want you The moments right here Look around, you can't miss it Wait, where did it go? A leaf flutters by Distracted from its one home It will die alone A walking taco Smashed chips with meat cheesebooze Then I'm smashed on couch A porcelain vase Colourful flowers and green Synthetic nature Seconds to decades Perplexingly cloudy Where am I going? Silence, I sit still How long unsure piano? Notes suddenly ring I am not ready For this or anything else So please, wait for me Whirlwind of nothing A blender of loneliness Smoothee of myself Yet you still smoulder An untamed blaze for all souls Gifted mystery Breath in, hold, breathe out Feel the air, enter your soul Repeat until calm My chest is still warm From the last hug you gave me My eternal spring I wrote this poem The gatekeeper frowns delete Smug satisfaction Summer cheeks flushed red His flesh, that of a stone fruit Full, I consume thee My cat weighed two stone Yet the Hummingbirds still know The branches she reached How can such beauty? Becoming simply forgotten A thing of the past 'Sale as always Only my tears touch the ground As life fades away Eighteen years have passed Sharp blue sky with no contrails A deep sad autumn You look like art when? You smile in my direction Priceless, beautiful Old wooden gate slams Startled a young Crow takes flight Wakes me from a thought Asking for a friend Online means more than one thing Shame or loneliness The sadness I feel Is one I have never felt? Make it go away Bird of paradise My nest was not enough, but You left a feather? Just watched the Oscars No one was running the show Much like the White House [Floating] Slowing down Falling drifting deeper now Sleep and rest your crown [Whisper of Roses] The winds carried it to her Hands, hide her red checks They're talking to me But they don't say any words They speak in colours Ground, dark, roasted beans Wafting aroma, caffeine A cup, steaming hot [Laughing Spirits] High Reconnecting old lost friends With dry wood crackling I will always be Your house plant stuck and waiting For you to come home The wiggles were right Fruit salad, yummy, yummy Best part of summer Doggo says hello I want to boop that sniffer And tickle those ears A red rose rises Out of the thick milky black Bathed by your shadow My laundry pocket Holded September's note when the Acorn had dropped in Carry me to depths But let me not dwell in them I still want to hope It bitterly aches To love somebody that hates Someone that you love They claimed it was hard I watched it destroy their grades I have no regrets Up in the far sky The big star is shining bright I think I miss you Always do your best Won or lost follow the way Leasons learned, repeat Mixing a drink with? Holy water unabsolved The sins that follow Am I but the wind? Quickly blowing through your leaves Then stillness again When I was younger I told the moon and the stars All of my secrets Not a wordly care Beyond that of eat sleep drink Can I be a cow? Short set of haiku For all of you to enjoy Please read the full post Time has become a Homogeneous mixture Tempooral smoothie The scent in the air The loneliness consumes me Am I strong enough? A laugh made of wax And a house made of butter Melted that summer Did we connect, friend? Love exchanged, but Joy escaped Hope carries us forth Was it all a dream? I most certainly hope not That was happiness I was in half sleep Flash glimpse of light manifest Arm, sleeve, strange device All eyes diverted To a turquoise bikini Shifting on the sand The nurse nurtures wounds Spy collects reconnaissance Hunter stalks his prey Fast and short and sweet Is how to write a haiku? Short attention span A happy life is Lived in perfect accordance With its own nature We all have soul mates Some are friends, some are lovers Some are kind strangers If the world's a stage Why do I feel like a prop? Bring on the last act Dreams in a snow globe Unkonventional romance Life has been shaken Mercy, forgiveness Drop the stone and walk away Now follow the lamb Raven looks at me I still stare back wondering If I see his ghosts Midnight bells call her I'm left with a glass slipper She does not want back Soft winds sway the pines And Mossy Oaks wave goodbye As the sun retreats A piece of her soul Slid off her shoulder today No one bat an eye The trade winds whispers Making the leaves and trees dance Breathing life to them Some people like to Create their own storms, then get Arrord when it rains It's been some time, friend Should I call you that, let me? Introduce myself We fight Cuz, we're bored We are circling talking Look for openings What do we put in? The post's description below Mogami River Stage two cancer, but? A dedicated teacher Classes continue Say that I'm not me I'm the one who said that, though Wow, that's too deep, man Last turn of the moon Luna fed round above looms I will be home soon World Poetry Day Even the magpie's squawking Has become haiku Year nineteen sixty Thou shall not speak a promise Of going to church The sad romantic Cries himself to sleep tonight Without shedding tears Before going blind I wish to see Aurora Dancing in the sky Sweat rolling down, brow Pavement reflects scorching heat Outdoor weightlifting Need encouragement Making myself positive I want happiness Constant discussions We never seem to agree Still laughing loudly For the manicure Trimmed and polished by the sun The moon left a tip Sour mandarin Your sweetness quickly faded Yet peelings remain What a great burden Honesty becomes such pain The lies continue Sun hit me like a Brick, who the fuck dropped the sun? Some rascal, that's who If I learned to hate It might not feel like my fault I wish you loved me How many times, Lord? How many times will I stray? And you come find me My therapist said I should not post on Reddit I just don't listen Of rain and seasons Of rivers, birds and of trees Haiku, not Senryu Harrful, melancholy accompanied by regret No abolishment I wrote a haiku About a kite because I Am as high as one I saw the reaper At the bottom of each glass Each refill more grim Little Birds sing songs They are very full of life One day it will end You grew up around Some toxic people I will Never forgive them Drink and smoke to cope Bury my heart, six feet deep Let time fill the hole Many songs to sing As a jailbird eyes the cage Can you hear the tweets? Falling out of reach Noodles are so slippery But Ramen is good Lasagna for lunch Clear skies, white clouds and slow jazz Canicular blues Heart knows what it wants I dream of love and romance But wake up alone My own favorites Autobiographical My stories, my lies Stupid human race Missing giant space rocks? The greatest filter God's architecture Thoughts unattended alone Palatial estates Imagine we all Said only using Haiku succinct eloquence O mother, my queen I miss the warmth of your womb Wish I died in there Her boyfriend is home Her eyes light up like the moon I reach for my pants Three in the morning I awake to him staring Unblinking at me Golden Aura cat Will you please light up my way? Push me through the dark I will fail this class One more year that goes to waste It could not be worse The absurdity Of people thinking they know Anything at all? The god is yet born Dark will continue to grow With collective might Today I lost you But more like a year ago I had lost myself A stable mindset Balance is bliss in the storm Continue searching Watching the sun rise Something awoke within me My indigestion I talk myself up Perception's always biased I am full of shit I hope to see you As I walk round the corner But you're never there Warm sun, children play Filled with thanks and Easter Joy A peak of heaven Fleeting form of joy Gone in a blink of an eye Ethereal you Tonsil surgery No hot, no cold, no solid And I got fired Smooth sip of whiskey His glass clinks on the table He quiets his mind Spring rumination False friendships like a foul seed Costs sower nothing Blue picture language Rain mothers bare their gray breasts Sky blood shadows through The first step is hard It is the most important Or is it the next? On a sunlit street Passing beneath the blossoms Distinct music plays Lone loon floats at night Dire plaintive call to his mate Where are you, my love? Driftwood upon stone Like a fist raised in the sky [Opaline] Eyes blink You live in a land I am forced to abandon When my eyes open Real or illusion What happens to a moment? Changed by memory The moon, a phantom Orange shifting, wavering Swimming in brandy Staring at the wall My melatonin working Sleep is approaching Do you remember? Good times, bad times love we shared Bonds of love renewed Is spring not just an? Erawakening of the Earth From near Lethal Dream What a long way down? I am tired of the climb Tell my friends goodbye Water flows, cascades Rocks tower in shade and light Drama yet tranquil Moonbeams flood the room Sleepless nights are nothing new Be brave,keep going A quiet river Salmon, jump up, waterfalls A bear gets a snack The accusing eyes In taxidermy, mounts are Glaring at the guns Which face will I wear? And what truths will I tell you? I don't know myself My toes curl up tight (Grippling) Ancient tree branches When your seed is sown The sky is still dark Don't wake me up so early Going back to sleep? A summer cooler Tied in to pack the blocks for A winter fortress Moisterias buzz near Sticky red strawberry hands Swift sting of sweetness Early summer rain The lonely horror of life Mud pours in the street I want to go back I liked my self way better Back back in the past Innocence incensed Teachers, parents and preachers All they say is nice Depression hits hard I struggle with living well One day at a time To be immortal Cryogenically frozen I awake in space Yes, I am in love There I said it, I love you I love you, goodbye A forest of trees For the Nazis have been Sprinking up in lots The lungs of the Earth Lay motionless and silent In a box outside Starving baby bird Nobody will come for you Choose your end and fly Awoke at midnight Thunder banging at my door Zeus is drunk again I am allowed privs A monitored desktop job No, deodorant Self conscious morning A little Joe, little Jane Breakfast sausages It was the night time A welder in the train yard All the sparks flying I see trees of green Red Roses, too, I see them Bloom for me and you (Usename: Sunset) Then over the horizon Throwaway account Unless you know me I appear to you, my friend A contradiction Gone in an instant I know I'll still think of you Threes fall knowing truth Why does every? grocery store manager Choose to wear a vest Made by milkweed for The King of Caterpillars The monarch, Muffler It is sad, but true That bitter experience Makes great poetry Two of three lines done Poetic constipation Finishing is hard Crush them, crush them all Until they turn to diamonds Pure unyielding clear Savor your time here For it will deplete quickly Live without regrets I walk through the past The streets are filled with color Somehow they're still dull Do not even try To make me go there outside I am having class Severage and calming A cooling breeze brings relief This hot summer day The clock keeps turning I made it another year I'm disappointed Wahn up with a kiss Just to find I was alone Affection rehab As I grow older The child in me slips away I fight to hold on Urgent nighttime strides Caged red lights activated Rain pelts a lone pane Accept these feelings For they are temporary And life will move on Seeds in hand,planted Furtherment and harvestyours Such joy in your work Freya, I beseech My internal war rages Love lost, I am lost This bat soup is good Oh, no, the whole world is dead Coronavirus Tears of wax aflame Condescending steadily down A crying candle Don't fear truth concealed A sea of irrelevance That's where truth will drown Shall I compare thee? To a summer's day, Alas It shall not be done You jumping on me? Covered in pink polka dots No reason, but love Don't know what it means To be a human being I know what it's like Sitting here, I be Writing this haiku for you Hoping for some praise Hitler, as you know Came from a whole family Who used to hitle? Always you lead me My footprint in your imprint With each step, there's love Do you remember? I know I am late to this Love changes the mind Having hit submit Your anonymous applause The author awaits The morning birdsongs A delightful melody Music to my ears Nazis on the run They live in Argentina Let's leave them alone My penis fell off So my hot glue gun fixed it Now I am crippled I'm a courier I help Santa at Christmas Never once said thanks I had to tell him A secret I was hiding He was not my son Then there was your smile Then my life changed forever Then my soul sang'thanks' Men and honesty Although not complete strangers Can pass each other Old age pads your mind Like fat and bad memories Hard to get rid of Is that all you have? A blackberry lemonade A tart empty life Change begins right now Let music and dance commence Coordination These wonderful things Are misery within to? Those who possess them Since mum passed away My whole world is upside down Where are the clean clothes? Cool mornings, embrace Splashing dew in the sunlight Thoughts of you linger Afraiding sadness My love seeks another yet The ocean is calm Invisible bricks Construct imaginary Blockades with purpose Suddenly I smile As we stare at the sunrise Because I met you Fluorescent flickers Bare feet cold on the roadway Enough headed fool Chrysanthemum, Bod Accepting all of the bees How indecent you? I find this girl cool Texting her is like a dream I kinda love her I'm in love with you I carry on like I'm not I'm hurting myself Bass line walks and talks With my headphones on, I smile Listening to jazz? You are more than just Those arbitrary labels That you hide behind The bloated green leaf Shudders in the utmost fear Of cold northern winds Camping in autumn Awakened by falling leaves Landing on my face On the porch one night I helped him to cry by just Silently rocking Crowd of witnesses So we areservants also Filled with hope and joy The sun keeps rising To teach us the meaning of Road slush and red lights How to milk almonds? Step one, gather all your nuts Step two, buy real milk Ambulance, siren For whom does it hurry now? It hurries for me Somebody saved me From myself, I go through life With my eyes wide shut Cold, lifeless sleep ends Animals slowly emerge Earth reawakens How unnatural? Are all the crowded places? With no one around Poetry, my art Can't draw nor paint, sing or dance Words are all I have This generation Fingers in bad, bad places Electronica Dancing in the wind Thin and fragile in the end Go begin again Drawing herself close His shoulders tense on the seat They are not lovers Home in a vowel And a scrubby consonant Spelling out sparrows Autumn winds blow hard Loud rain announces each spring Winter snow falls mute Night fades with first light Sun's returning, it's all right Time for a haiku Still in the present Moving toward the future Rewinding the past Terrified of this Demon that keeps haunting me You will not best me Giving to strangers Spreads faith in humanity You are loved, my friend Share in happiness It's the good times that will stick Get over yourself Jade Green, Navy Blue We wait alone together A sunrise from you Forever itching The river swirls and stretches Beating for a scratch? Turning into dust With the moon under my feet I'm getting older The forsaken day Many raiders assemble Run like Naruto I cut off his hand Pleading I reveal the truth I am your father The nighttime thunder Frightens, animals and birds My peaceful slumber Like kissing stardust I become engulfed by you Stomaching me whole Autumn leaves falling Barcen trees under grey clouds Unfilled until spring Inspired by you I prepare to teach and share Thank you, Lord Jesus A bright shooting star You flew through my bleak dark life I miss your warm glow My own reflection Fades away into the glass With each sip I take There's a wasp in here Leave and I will let you live Please do not sting me My heart beats for her The one who can give me life The one who takes it The pain stays hidden So they might live their lives, right? I gladly suffer Pale afternoon sky A breeze invites trees to dance Wind, chimes sing along Pain in your body Desperation in your soul Beauty still within Voice sweet like honey Fluttering heart when eyes laid You are my one wish The heavens shine down Constables drawn by man Stories to be told Of the stages five Denial is the most fun Ignorance is bliss The false friends stalk you The snakes constantly deceive Crush them underfoot Aimless wanderer A soul without home or kin An unwanted stray Watercolored skies Reflect off the stepping stones Lighting the cat's face End the day outside Wasted the watercolor Suppose I'll need more Sky spouts of water From which cloud villages drink? To quench their dry throats Refrigerator Refrigerator again Refrigerator You won't hold me now Yet still my clipped wings will hurt Must you hold me down? All of life's lessons Start with a single step In the unknown Ecstacy at work Makes it hard to concentrate But my desk feels cool Writing worth reading Pouring ink onto pages A life worth living Heavenly fragrance Drifts through mild breeze, what is it? Ah, Hyacinth Blooms I long for it so Your touch and delicate taste Yet you pull away In my sleep, I dream Dreams of life scenarios Imperturbable An orange sky rose Deep purple and quiet blue Fade away for day Breath taken away Heart now seems to be racing Can't believe my eyes So many projects Filling my day blessed, am I? Thanks for the help, Lord Sparks in velvet dark Beautiful, enchanting, bright Memories of you Cars are passing by Always eager to go back This road takes us home Beyond meat burger Small French fries and small iced tea Beyond basic lunch Now I see the point No more running after smoke Danced with the flames Forget emotions Erase lingering feelings Sweet, sweet catharsis Goddess of the Sleep How long will you hide from me? Show up, embrace me Look into my eyes A fallen king with no throne I am a tyrant In isolation Date night is facials and wine Maybe a foot rub Digital scrolls lost Bytes cascade as grains of sand Dunes line the landscape The mountains will rise The shadows will grow with them Bathing us in black A thousand lifetimes Of sin glass stained with crimson Bloody sunrise dawns Twoths of planets Think of all the love stories A universe full United in faith Brief steps to eternity Always love for you Your love gives me strength I stumble and you are there Lord, such perfect love Holding his great bow He strides down the mountainside Vengeful, Apollo Dark clouds split apart A warm presence is now felt As light bathes the world At the DMV Everyone waits far too long Wait, did I miss it? Dark end of tunnel Not seeing light in future Learn to live alone Things are getting real Instead of burning too bright We simmer each night This is beautiful Holding your perfume fingers Looking at nature Wrong up from the womb The previous life was just A terrible dream Small drops fall wetly Could this be a spring shower? No sunshine cuts through Humid lighting storm Summer in San Francisco The apocalypse Winter Marine fog Condensing life into death Near a pumpkin patch Lightning decided For no apparent reason To hit the old man I'm afraid to love I've been torn too many times Just leave me alone Can't negotiate Your release because fool you Took yourself hostage Mole constellations Cosmos ever expanding? Love you, anyway Caught in summer rain Running to hide, but laughing 'Cause we are in love With one single snap The sub perfectly balanced As all things should be A turn of events That makes very little sense Possessions A muted panic People are leaving quickly Somebody coughing I called my boss, Dad My boss is not my father Going home early? Unexpected change A mountain creek springs from stone Wonder where it flows Why is it always? The best of us that get hurt No one notices I can't sing or draw But at least I have Haikus To express myself Manly suicide Is the struggle up the path? To meet the reaper One for the bucket And one for both of the bails Who will carry whom? Autumnal essence Sweet scent of summer fading Winter foreboding Walking in the dunes Following paths made by Deer Hoof prints in the sand Splashes of red blood Lumps of dark bruises from pain Murdered by artform Love's a funny thing Say you mean the world to them And then someone else Look to the future Tomorrow, learn Mandarin Afterwards, speak gold I sit on the lawn Beer in my hand, a cold one I watch the fireworks Your words embraced me Such joy filled my heart and soul Fixed in memory When was the last time? That you looked for something new Are you even there? My sweet birdy girl Lying cozy on my lap What do you dream of? Breaking bread with friends Wine flowing like Crimson tide A breath of fresh air Five feet separates My computer from my bed My daily commute I do have good friends But one thought just makes me blue No one's really here In this day and age You cannot trust anyone Always turn your back An ember light casts Relief in emerald whispers A floral perfume It has been some time Rainclouds were discipating The storm gets closer My mare keeps me up She trots across tired eyes Sweet mare of the night wasting time with tech Life too short for these issues Can I walk away? The moon has risen Beaming down to guide my way Lost but found but lost A world divided Under the differences Look for common ground An askreddit post Question is, what love feels like? Do I even know? Memories of youth Hopes and dreams we shared my love For now, forever Ya'll want a haiku You want a fucking haiku? Well, then there you go Sporting a black eye And snuffing out the sun while The moon took over When sweet evening comes I feel my life exhaling I bask in gladness Everything changes The way I feel about life Changes everything Stones smooth to the touch Have all been smashed and worn down? By the Earth's rivers Like a house of cards My cultivated habits Have fallen apart Binge watching Kung Fu On Amazon Prime TV Oh, those seventies My motivation Flickers like a dying light Bright one day then dim Bad leads to okay? Okay, leads to good, then great This is a haiku We can only hope That a dark reddit ui Now brightens the mood Blood vessels branch out From frozen hearts and grey flesh Black trees of winter Hear the cicadas So alien and haunting Like a waking dream The space is so big Bindless possibilities Makes me feel so small Your thoughts kept private How I long to share with you? Love tears, bridge the gap Fout mouthed chain smoking Hard drinking crazy red hair Punk, rock fucking love The littlelest corpse Was not the slowest around Others had lost legs New toilet paper One question must be answered Under or over Socially distanced Wishing I could hug you all I miss human touch Through the panes of glass The light is out of the eyes It shines in the heart She has no money Christmas will be hard this year With three mouths to feed Still, waters disturbed Concentric ripples shimmer A surfacing loon Run through your soft hair Dig into your rough tanned skin Get lost in your eyes Ultimate cuddles Let's become octopuses No bones, only beaks As the city sleeps Silence grows the air freshens Perfect for deep thoughts Best friend or girlfriend I have so many girl friends In love with them all Life is breathtaking Like a vine around my throat Time for some pruning The cloud drifts aloft Who knew a mountain could be? A feather also I am Hangover The thought of booze makes me sick Happy New Year friends Open the door, babe I'm sorry for everything Please just let me in Possessions Innocence in the real world Probabilities Big, sweaty penis Slapping around in my ass Oh, no, I'm shitting Yes, yes yes, yes yes No, no, no, no, no no Probably been done Dreaming of success Wishes of being debt free Where do I begin? I am no poet I write Haiku though sometimes Pretendious at best Tonight, the moon mourns Wind sweeping her thin gray veil Discloses her sorrow Pursuing walls of steam Hot soap just went through my thighs Hands tight on the wall April amplifies Curbing the volume for the Music of songbirds Massive angry beasts Out for blood and nothing else Creativity of nightmares I was a moonbeam Shining on a plastic bag Old ripped and dusty I can feel it too So what am I waiting for? I'm afraid of you You need to believe I need to learn trust again We once had the two Bees bumble above Grass bends beneath necks and knees Let's become honey Are your nipples free? Somebody asked me online I told him they were Starshine Horizon This gravity can save us Breaking the red shift The ruler of hell Eye of the witch at the graves The King of Diamonds This is how she bleeds Bright red drops on a white floor Pretending all's well Start of my haiku This haiku might not make sense This does not make sense Moving is pointless I have always been this way Slipping through the cracks How anxious am I? To see black powdery smoke Poison the blue sky Yellow flicked to red A preposterous distance Gunned it anyway Let's burn everything Tim, where'd you put the lighter? You left it at home An image of trees The rain starting to move by Quiet cicadas A child's bicycle Upended in the backyard Reechoes of laughter A life is fleeting Just like the falling blossom Allow the scatter Been feeling so low But it cannot hurt us now I don't give a fuck A cold, stormy night Rain has washed away the day Fresh start tomorrow You don't owe the past The only thing that lingers Is your wasted time? Desert and mountains What lay between us is vast Today you felt close Buffet for bunnies All you can eat vegetables Fenced off in the yard There is a darkness Ach, just below the surface Just fighting for air Tears flood down my cheek Meaningless to your cold heart I pray to be free And then the sun set The light from a million stars Brought tears to my eyes God will pay for this That deceitful piece of shit Wipe it off the earth A summer evening Trash TV, popcorn and you Put you phone away Heart flutters each time You spare a moment for me? Too late, see your ring You me together? Staring at the moonlit sky Heartbeats are in sync Hard at work, I sleep In the hazel lilac shade Extended lunchbreak Only those without Wings can defy gravity Some skies aren't enough Thin howling pressure In the pit of my stomach Plummet to concrete Red ribbon draping All down the arch of her back She is so lovely In the cool water The moon cuts a white ripple The calm of the night It is a long quest Millions of teas and teapots Find yours be happy Deep breaths of warm air Barbeques and wet pavement Parfum of summer Her lipstick was red What colour was her dress red? Her shoes, too, were red Reading poetry By people I've never met It keeps me alive Action Washing salty cars in spring Flurries in three days Bread and circuses Surround me both of my sides There is no escape The leaves start to change Pumpkins begin to ripen Year draws to a close Wet season arrives With muddy hems and soft groans Black umbrellas bloom Organization Getting syllables correct Careful verse Once upon a list Of my most frustrating things Watching my son sweep A melody in To another flows a third Divine counterpoint Here we are again Another fork in the road Are you still coming? Each passing second Will mean a minute longer I can barely sleep Formulating plans Exit strategy of sorts Slowly, but surely By myself again Will you keep me company? To get through this night Life is but a whim For beauty is to behold Death, the final breathe Poor, lonely bluebird A full life of skipping trees Full of leaves and stays Adulting is hard No trophies for being real All you get are scars Good morning, I lie You leave, don't say I love you Ah, marital bliss Solitary bee Make a home between my ears An old light fixture My life is a waste I knew it was from the start I want to go home Nothing seems to last Evening star, you come so fast Roads wear a white mask I used to like it My writing voice really did But then I heard yours Waiting for so long He'll come back for me one day Drunky, doctor A conversation Of how I met you today Warm notion, respond When debugging code? My time is tracked by counting The mugs of coffee A still harvest moon Flutters over the lagoon Where a duck jumped in? Sometimes I kiss you To steal some of your chapstick I hope that's OK Absolutely still Not one leaf moves in the heat Indian summer A fresh start is nigh A little slice of death, no? Then new life at dawn Dark at five o'clock It seems like daylight savings Account has no funds Blood is on your hands Want your freedom so you can Delight in my death Victory Coffee Torture me and rebuild me I love big brother The dork in my heart Brings me joy and ecstasy This girl is just love Amber is so rad She makes me feel really good I really love her Enough recliner And dark television screen Constant reminders boo, did I scare you? It's me I'm the living dead Happy Halloween Earlier today A small decoration sleeps A ceramic duck A lonely rose lives Though old leaves begin to fall Now a new bud grows Petal bliss is yours Breathless at a moment's thought Never shall we touch? Water filled with mud Only reflects distortions Fragmentary truths This calm valley path The breath of the spring winds cool This path has stories It comes from nowhere To torture me with its shade The thought of death stays Multiple choice test What does future hold for me? A b c or d Always hating me Forever resenting me Never forgiving Spiders, siphon, screams Morning showers come to pass Insects crave a voice Subwayless clouded skies Cloak the deep autumn sunset Wet leaves cling to wool Midsummer sunlight [Bushs into the garden cove] Bare skin bathed in gold Dreams are effortless Which is why dreaming is more Popular than work This beautiful life Full of wonder and intrigue Always amazes I begged for mercy But all I heard was silence While I bled to death Waiting for something Such as a conversation To start or something Richard, the world is Even when isolated To have you in it I long to see stars But I live in a city There's no starlight here A bittersweet night Clearing my head in a park Need to clear my heart Get back on your game In the lengthening of days And run out your hit Shrinking myself to Make the love you give me seem Plenty and complete Thousand sparkling suns Grease me on my morning walk Dew drops on grass tips I rolled all your socks Folded your clean underwear Happy Valentines Twenty six minutes I've cried out and chipped away No one seems to care Let us run away Out where no one can find us We'll laugh at the world Pleasure turns to chore Once unique, it's now routine And time rages on He said, Come and see As the seal broke, I embraced Changes are coming The world keeps turning I can feel it, turn away Was I ever there? Trying too hard is Envious of loveliness Wearing modesty Encrypted sonnets Scrawled in old sidewalk Patois Whisp'ring my vices Round and round, you go Pressed into the grooves you sing Pursuing my soul I feel things deeply But speaking in emotions Always makes me choke I carry your words Erased on paper, brain and heart Tattooed on my soul Thoughts start to regress Too far down in the abyss Embraced by darkness The bud disappears To let the blossom break through Death rewards living A river willow Under it, the waters pool Perfect reflection Well, hello, Reddit I have written a haiku And you have read it The blue light special Reservations are made for Appearing in court Summer boils the blood Fools, let it go to their head Cool down with a drink What's this, a toilet? No, we like shitting outdoors This is India If your erection Lasts longer than four stories Call your contractor I can't fall asleep The faces in the window Are waiting to pounce Starving baby bird Nobody will come for you Choose your end, amd fly Why the resistance? To the thoughts I have of you We use to be close Though truth deeply cuts Clarity with heartfelt warmth Is my wish for you? Feather fur and fin Witnesses to deity Is all creation? A little tyrant With bleached bones in a neat row Celebrating death? Sugar maples tapped Slow sap drips into buckets Sap boiled makes syrup Snow falls quietly Silence is all that is heard Warm vapor exhaled Just another one I'm just not pretty enough Distracted again Thor brings lightning forth Striking hammer on anvil Lightning splits the sky Raindrops, massage me Upon a boat in the sea Being rocked gently I won't kill myself So many things left to do? My list is all drugs My spiral tower Evaporates like spring snow A church bell ringing I open the door Dust crumbles beneath my feet I look away too Searching for the light Peace, love and understanding What is so funny? Oh, the thunderstorm Patrick, Swedish exuberance Stay in the moment In the box and out We like to move them around Stop and let them be Flashbacks and trauma Memories and dreams seem real Will I lose myself? Where has the time gone? That is not my reflection Pieces on the floor Contemplate this thought You will not get this day back The room went silent Behind this face I'm more than my surface shows Must repair the cracks You're so beautiful Photographs and memories Don't do you justice On apps full of men Always potential for love I'll just masturbate A vivid sunset Shines so bright and beautiful But, oh, so short lived Hawaii, one day Coconuts to sustain us Sleeping on the beach I still remember How the snow fell to the ground? The night my heart broke Lying is the most Fun, a girl can have without Taking off her clothes? Three words unable Living life in a fable I am so confused A forlorn figure In a desolate wasteland Someone please save me The breeze fills my space I find no warmth in covers I am not safe here After the exam Many months with no contact Tear on my shoulder Bloated and puffy An evil and ugly troll Go back to your bridge The sound of your voice Like a gentle lullaby Sending me to sleep Do you remember? When exploring hallway stairs Was adventurous How many of us? Go through life without seeing Midgets on fire The heavy fog wanes Unfortunately, I am Right where I began The shirt smells like you A scent once so rare is now Traciousally common Turning off the news Distractions, stunt growth and peace Trump, don't kill my vibe Find your happy place Run through it naked at night Listen to no one Now is the first time I did not feel my heart throb As you passed these halls The day has arrived Doctors detect no heartbeat I push solemnly Rivers of spacetime Fry through us and spill away In the darkness Overzealous hands Life's too short for too much care Let the people live Santa clearly knew The reindeer bullied Rudolph Christmas tribunal Yes, mental illness It is on the menu now Let me have some, please Only two more miles I just realized my life sucks Damn you, hot cheetos Conform to bias See me even when you sleep Time it seems is now You planted flowers Between all my ribs and you Turned me into spring Sunset on water The tang of salt on the breeze A single seagull At the register They exhale too close to me Masked identities I feel so lonely I have this feeling of dread Continually nagging On the internet People will sometimes say things That they do not mean Festival, Merch Booth This cannibal bought two shirts Ol' one upper jones Eternal sunlight Pursuing the darkness within Open eyes again A cleansing fire Phoenix lost in his mistake Make today the new Sadder than ever To the girl that loves me most Better run quickly The joy is shallow When promise is a mirage? That has fooled us all Look, now it is bright Light through naked trees shines stark Rows of huddled homes Rivers of concrete Herds of mammals trample feet Urban jungle beat This is a haiku About something really deep Maria's trench You're a lot like jazz Great when I am in the mood But right now I'm not Gave them forever They were careless and lost it Now it's mine again A few speed demons Rushing to infinity Hamsters deep in thought Arms outstretched, we were Exchanging grins as we fell My chute has a hole Beautiful today My car is getting polished It is now raining Stars burn in the sky Snow crunches beneath my feet Breath burns in my lungs Shouting sunlight Warm breezes across the lake From under the pier How very awkward? You could say embarrassing Made a fool of I I fell in love once The best feeling life can bring Here, look at my scars I awoke to late My sled now scrapes on concrete Maybe next winter Nature loves to act To play with dreaming c'est tout With viridity One crown rules us all Will we ever dance again? For now, just silence Joy fills all of me Love warms my soul, it is yours Your hand, please let's walk Pride got in the way Service to you was weakened Often do I fail? The light of the sun Sets over my time and soul I will be free soon A defect is found The deployment is at risk Please do the needful Silent depth and breadth Can I bridge such an expanse? Together we will Taboo on my lips A shell of myself, the curse I cry for my youth I am a lone wolf Not because I choose to be I was born alone If this were the end Why might that be a reason? Not to give your all Wine spilt on my shirt Smell like an alcoholic Depression sets in My great grandmother Saint Laurent Manitoba Handmade Moccasins In receiving hands Interception of the kites At the tree goal line I need underwear And to organize my socks Is my life going? We're all gonna die There is no shortcut to death You must live to die Purple, Sparkles, shine Green lights flashing everywhere Plants on amethyst Balding hairy boss Keep your hand off my shoulder Go grope someone else You don't wash your belt But it's the first thing you touch After you go, poo Something has gone wrong It must be my fault again This destroys my mind I'm ready to rock But your big hands, husky voice My thai vacation 'Always lumpy bed Through the half sheeted window Watching the snow fall Although you say it I know that you are lying Those three little words For some damn reason Whenever it comes to you My heart's wide open For the second day Passing by a blooming bud How continuous? Putting down a straw? And slurping a beverage In a waterspout So riddle me this What brings exhaustion and joy? Waking up on time She took my reason Things that seemed so sensible We're certainly not Pushing pushing then All the pressure releases A cry of new life You still don't get it I'll never care what you think Whether good or bad Rockabye, baby I will always protect you Nothing will harm you Now, almost a year You were supposed to be here Tears come all to near Hot pavement, City I know it's a magic trick Wilding day and night Inside my body There is a tasty walnut I am walnut man Where are you right now? Who still knows your deepest fears? Are you loved and fed? Heart pumping faster Pumping throughout the body Blood out of sad scars Woodpecker, drumming Natural percussionist Now he has his fill Like a broken tree My heart leans in constant fear Waiting for a breeze Uncertain future Can't modify the past Make today awesome Ready to die now? Pig assisted suicide Only no martyrs Too many niggers I need a lot more triggers To shoot them all with Please deliver me From the unending madness That is my being I saw them today It was just the rain pouring I know they're coming Your face, a new moon I know only your shadow Blotting out the stars I'm done pondering Take all of my belongings I'm just so tired Spike away time Ten more minutes have just passed Where is my yes man? Your story touched us Hearts and minds were ever changed Thank you for that gift Feeling the freedom Swing above the water Staring at the sky Oh, my God, I swear Why is everything on here? So dark and edgy The morning brings us A shining new horizon This brand new skyline Tempered glass towers Made for the gods Rust covered shovel Come pollinators Corolla coloured brightly On to the stigma It will continue Until there is no more will Then I will be gone Disasterynow End of patience,new way sought Such a distraction I thought I'd be gone Looking for someone to love Good thing I found you Sorry, Apollo You know, I like you a lot But not all the time Sometimes I feel down I get a weight in my chest But tears will not flow Do you know something? Hypocrites are everywhere You may be one too None of us voted For local riot police But we all have them This Thanksgiving day Don't say grace for what you have Thing of the have not's End the day outside Used up the watercolor Hope you buy me more A turn of events That seems to make little sense Possessions Bare branches hold gems Foggy slate swallows them up How fleeting they are? Spiritadvocates Spiritreveals saturates (Spiritual) Perfect love Plagity is The sincerest compliment In literature I am at a loss What will I do with myself? Probably something Hawk's cry far away Surveying his realm by sky All is in order Trying to balance Qi ping pong and breathing deep Both seem to help me Don't take it from me Hopeless dreams, melancholy This is all I have Barred apples and A squashing of cornstalks in Thanks for the giving Evening equation Footes minus shoes plus carpet Equals elation Long after I've gone Trees whisper to each other With unheard echoes Sat on the toilet No tp sink and a hand Problem solving skills I hear your name in Silence and I see your face In an empty room Cold air burns my lungs While the wind it chaps my face Smile, frozen jogging Go leave me alone Sitting here on what I call My lone empty throne If anyone cares I have hidden a treasure For someone to find Is this the real life?

I am all alone I am a tool for her use I am very cold The stars have gone out Some sleepy song of Robins Give me ears to hear Master of deceit The sadness hides in my smile Never let them know Cleaning out the fridge Behind the old Chinese food I spot moldy cheese It is amusing That which we call the cosmos Does not care for us Why am I so sad?

The new place echoes This is for me now My time and place in this life Will grow and sprout joy Yeah, I want some bread I hope it's not yucky bread This bread sure tastes good Clouds in summer skies Drill like my sense of purpose I seek direction I lost my best friend Long talks turned into silence I lost my lover Harrible spring rains linger Flash floods swarm the canyon floor We take the high road I want to matter To feel special to someone Why is that so hard? Winnowings of Fall I can't see blue anymore Try this on for size Sometimes I need food Sometimes you need a blowjob Sometimes we need both Only weed and sex An insatiable hunger Please satisfy me Words without meaning The bliss you speak of is just An empty promise Gentle morning breeze Nothing lasts forever but Sweet smells fills the air Southern Hemisphere Hitherto mythical lands Toilet swirls the same Tears of saltiness Rolling down my fragile cheek At least I can feel Broken pine needles Bare feet, find a secret place The valley below Your smile sent shock waves That I forgot I have lungs And my legs have knees The house walls are thin Outside the frogs are croaking My wife is snoring The sleepless nights end The bottles are sealed for good Present to the now I have the pleasure Of seeing you in dreams when Distance divides us Scroll through reddit, yes Take five mins to push out turd The satisfaction So loud, I wake up My cat has sleep, Apnea So sad yet so cute The wind section is Conducted by the maestro Blowing through the march By myself, I fly Alone I crash to the ground Together you laugh Each moment, a gift Never exactly again Trouts of remembrance Anger, frustration Starts with sadness, then evolves What is the lesson? Rainy, snowy days I got sunshine by the bag A short term escape More efficiency Combine the activities Brush teeth in shower My little flower Lift your head now, open up It's time to blossom Time to surrender Everything you want and love All that you regret Love makes me weary Left out in the cold of night With the dogs of Yore The wind blows through trees Clouds racing across the skies I can't stop yawning Breathing in then out Eyes closed, thoughts float by like clouds Meditation om Bad blood needs purging Only the pain slows my mind Well deserved penance Why is this so hard? I'm told it gets easier Guess I'll keep waiting Not to long before A dreamscape tapped my shoulder Curious contact Two eyes, one story Sometimes rain and sometimes clouds His eyes, my story The Canada Geese Are often heard before seen Mid winter sunset The sound of the rain Is wafting through the window? It is getting dark Don't know how to live Hang on to whatever hope Falling through the sky I find pleasure here You can find it over there We're one vibration 'Sale in my mind My thoughts, my thoughts, my thoughts shit My mind needs be shut Precinct from above When in the presence of light Icicles can fall Winter spring summer Throughout them all, I await Till the first leaves fall Faced with two choices To take root or to take wing Which will my soul choose? Else thoughts linger The blue sky became my guide An endless journey Ears flap through tall grass Up then gone then up again Dog after rabbit A warm puppy butt Sleeping closely by my side Feels like home to me I am not okay Negative thoughts fill my head I want this to end Pesky bugs bite bare Knifes as blades of sharp grass Tickle naked legs Chinese buffet shop It left me feeling tortured Wantanamo bay? Pursueful mindfulness I listen to the clock tick Here comes the morning The river rises Sending my snowman downstream To sleep with fishes Little ketchup bags Lying huddled on counter Unused, unwanted Bella Chapina Pelo Negro, Rizado Ojos Hermosos Laying together At night, giggling like kids Is what I miss most? I won't take shelter Magnificent thunderstorm Melch me all away A sense of balance Subject to the winds of change Dance the path of life Do I change myself? Or should I be who I am? I think it's bed time The three little words That changed my life forever Rid or die, she said I really hate Sean He looks at me stupidly Coughs are super cool An odd sensation To feel sorrow so deep with No tears left to shed Golden Fields shimmer The flowers are now sleeping Yellow leaves fall down Lost in the graveyard Brought in the sea of graves A hand touches me Fear makes my soul rot The waves drop pinning me down We shall meet again Birds chirp in the trees Sun light piercing the green leaves Small eggs start to hatch I should go now, you Tired of being so small Did you ever think? Words make you think thoughts Music makes you feel feelings Songs make you feel thoughts Yellowed memories Derelict thoughts grasp at straws As the mind withers Ants work and die for Their queen is this just instinct Duty or plain love My dog hates the mail Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof? No love for the mail I'm ready to write The world's greatest haiku but My mind is still blank A face of soft silk Warm rays in the skin reflects Gentle touch of love Fumbling first kiss Learning each other's rhythm Taste apprehension Why do you downvote? A decent haiku, are you? Loving of real skills Hard times, lie ahead Hopes and dreams crumble away Leaving deep despair When I was younger I thought love was a feeling When it was a choice My heart is dragon Waiting for you to slay it So we can be rich The passenger seat An extra cutlery set Without a cohort The scent of Amber My nose in her hair, Inhales Close my eyes and smile Blinded by the smog Can't stop me from seeing straight Breath in and breathe out The reason you left? Was it because you ran out? Of reasons to stay Locking all the doors An ocean surrounding me I got to break free We remember when Smiles, frowns, cries of joy and pain Ever family In a raging storm Mind completely calm within Beyond all the noise I can hear my heart As the noose starts to tighten And time starts to slide Oh, drowning sorrows Back to what that meant before What a tragic waste Soon I'll be gone too How will they remember me? Kiss my head, goodnight High expectations Another month passes by Forgettable promise A cold night guilt strikes From outside my toasty house I let the dogs in Working together Roadblocks cleared love set in place Your grace is enough Potrop is in me You have put it in my veins This pain will not end Though I have allies My first comrade is myself I won't ignore you Sexual lover Why do you cum oh so fast? Can I mount again? Asked what the rules were Everyone stood silently Walked out of fight club Spunny tendrils twirl Nag champa burns steadily Inhale peace of mind Snitches, get stitches If they don't have insurance They will bleed out fast An old, well, mossy A falling leaf breaks fine threads Cracks its wooden face Today we journey Ever with us, Lord Jesus Grace is all we need Long green grass rustles A fat bumpy toad appears A bad day redeemed Enough bowls and cups Parts of you and me and us Some days are harder Blute out from the bark Seep in the heat, crystallize Amber suspension I'm constipated Tryna think of a haiku Nothing is coming White flower blooming Out of place one might have said Growing here early Warm crackling fire Mobilel and a good movie Lazy afternoon Can I see the love? Looking past pain, suffering Such wisdom for me Daybreak comes at last Now the dark of night is past Have a nice breakfast Having the answers? Inquisitive by nature Knowing the unknown A beautiful star Brightest I have ever seen Shines inside of you If saying goodbye I suppose I should start by Taking off my shoes Upsets and setbacks Each step plagued by entropy John, sixteen, three, three Chubby cats on rafts They float downstream back to back Old felines, relax Flex when you have to You do not know your place yet The flex is mine, bitch Will you ever learn? See things as they really are Like I see the world I kilm with kindness While I suffer in silence We all die alone Endangered road ahead The overcast sky hangs low I am coming home Bare, knuckle boxing With a tear covered pillow Insomnia woes Another weekend Filled up by ambitious plans Ends with hangover Laying next to you Breathing becomes easier Daydreams melt to sleep The car slowly cools Dubious winter, dirty snow sky Coffee would be nice Hand sanitizer Hero of the pandemic Bane of paper cuts Some cherish problems And show their contempt for those Who see to solve them? Forgetting to eat Now I am forgoing sleep Passion found at last Leaves of amber wings Lost by Autumn's Equinox Sheen at dawn of spring A sea of faces Neon lights buzz overhead The android walked on Here's to wallowing When you're feeling really sad Observe all others Being aware of Being aware allows thoughts To lose their power Bowerbird's glamour Shiny objects spread neatly Looking for a mate [Habitalize] The boxes compose the space Puzzle games to see I stayed up all night Restless mind wanders to you Arms anchor me still You killed my father I'm inigo Montoya Now prepare to die Autumn colours fall Sounding of wind streams and life New beginnings soon That is all they do Middle ignorance What are they hiding? Do you want to hear? The words that were left unsaid What I want to say? I do not falter On the steep and savage path But for the poet Drunken thoughts burning A sparrow weeps on this day Unbelieved wounded The last smile I saw Weary eyes with a huge heart I miss you, Nonna Failing to give thanks How can you love me so much? Ever blessed, am I? I wrote a haiku I feel it should be deep but I lost my shovel I miss the old times I wish we could just go back When there was still love Your flower blossoms Your petals glisten with dew I'm buzzing for you I bought a puppy A dagger into my heart Because all things die I say, Marhaban She smiles at a word from home In a foreign land I lie deathly still The world around me moves on Unfazed undeterred I'm a Guillotine Some deserve their severance Wealth can't save you now Hair on the tile floor Fully booked with dream clients Success in passion Incense smoke rises Through fall afternoon sunlight Cars sounds like river Is this chance or fate? A tree of contingencies Or a scripted play This moon is ancient And the darkness that awes you Grinds at you is too Verified knowledge The Alchemist family Been king of kings Dry, dying flower Waiting for the rain to fall Never gets its wish Stranger than fiction An inescapable truth To live, we must die Busy loving you Love freely given each day Such is my purpose Dispared by the wind The heat of summer long gone You're all that remains Handfuls of roses Fingers bloodied by the thorns Each drop is a gift Powering onward To pivot reposition Shifting gears boldly Are they listening? I feel like they always are Alexa Weather Saturn pulls my thoughts As he returns, I wonder What I'm doing here? Color everywhere The dancing shapes of my dreams Purple, gold and blue Big emergency Guys, I need some help right now Mom found the poop sock Eternal waiting Wake to sleep at nausea Forever a dream Darkness approaches Something evil this way comes Run away and hide I have a question Is pickpocketing a crime? If you don't get caught Dream about a thought An escape from the moment Where I cannot be You dream for your child And too soon, that dream comes true And yet your heart breaks I have gained knowledge Grown up yet still, I retain My youthful acne Wet heavy storm clouds Gather over a corn field Fist pounds on the door Last night I bought shoes Oh, not in real life, mind you This was in a dream Uninhibited Please be nothing more than raw Honest and truthful Serious question For people who study snakes Are snakes their own dicks? An endless longing The freedoms I had in youth Never to return You hold in your hand All the answers you could want If you believe it Slightly betrayal An action that cuts factions Trust no more be gone Be still like nightfall Quiet like the skies above Listen to the Earth I only need one Word to describe your beauty Intoxicating Together we learn Truths revealed, bring us such joy Happiness awaits The umami taste Slurping noodles with hot soup Strangers salivate The cool ocean breeze An invigorating scent I miss the sunsets Outside of myself Whispering pools of muddied thoughts Ain't no place to swim With glasses of love See without distortion now Such truth sets me free The great true master Beginner from beginning Enough cup retains Dance, pretty lilacs Bend delicately softly [Whisper in deaf ears] The last cigarette A ticket to the abyss I blame the lighter Desert safari Zebra's giraffes and lions At the waterhole Ugly jealousy Did you look them in the eyes? To me, you return Another pillbox We fight as one family Fear is in the mind A thought arises Loathed and lost by the spring wind To be born again Shrek is my daddy I want to suck his big cock Cum inside my mouth The most pure thing yet A genuine preference Need to be grounded The machine center Cogs gather to celebrate She keeps it running Insecurities The choppiest of waves crash Return to Stillness I am dressed like shit A pink shirt and grey sweat pants No one will see me Sparrows skid swiftly Between electric cables Dangerous but free You are a stranger Yet I feel at home content In your easy smile Blue and crystal waves Warmest dances over the skin White sand as canvas Speaking to myself From the future to the past Fuck, don't send that, please Her sexy red heels Made a rousing, Staccato Streel necks elongate What is a birthday? Celebrate a happy life Was it worth the pain? Dark thoughts and sad thoughts Voice would give them more power Thoughts not for sharing I am so confused On how to make a haiku? Please help me make one Misguided childhood Reprehensible adult Refusetable death The pillars are tall And the path is tremendous What is the purpose? I am my own man Different man from my dad Here we are alike An angry feeling Steers a moment from your life You can't get it back Weary, holy weak The pipe organ is wheezing Please rise already And then just like that Not so special after all I'm nothing to her Path is victory Understand your tomorrow Acceptation is you Why'd you tell me that? I don't know what to believe I'm too old for this Lung's burning mouth dry Running till the end of time Greatness is the prize Was I me that night? A night you won't soon forget Or just a body Let me be your wine But if you don't drink water You cannot have it I wish to fly high Yet I'm standing here alone Looking at the sky Why have cut flowers? In funerals, I think that One corpse is enough The Meds aren't working Worsing, gasping, for purpose Lifeguards off duty Follow the leader Not who says what he has done But who does what's said? Traveling is nice Just like Frank Sinatra says But home is nicer Sounds through my speakers My cell phone talks on its own It hears everything I stay up thinking Thoughts of who you think I am Who I think I am? Watching football game? Mahomes is doing great stuff Traversals like normal The lineman hooked A Role and hung by a thread to Repair the webbing You have watched the sun Someone comes into your life But they see the moon Unhindible terror Freedom through enlightenment Slave to seeking truth Buffet for bunnies All you can eat vegetables Crouching in cabbage My poetry sucks But I do even more so Just can't get better A stroll through the trees Goblin's attack three injured Dundeons and dragons Dropped calls, quick goodbyes Needing to believe your lies Loathing at a cost The wind on my face Feels so lovely, feels so pure Then I hit the ground Heaven reaching walls Contain the chaos outside The eye of the storm Feel a pen slipping How it slips informs the catch If you can catch it People everywhere Celebrating Saint Patrick Drinking too much beer? The cold wind blows hard Blowing the leaves off a tree Neaked defenseless The honk of a goose An unruly noise it is To make it press y My days feel empty I simply wait for bedtime Then repeat cycle You tilt at windmills? Say everything, promise not Oh, inquisition Life is worth living What I need to tell myself To keep my strength up Your fate closes in Resign yourself to darkness Or just get to work Trees happily shake A tired man deeply sighs As leaves, brush his lips The vibrant nature The bustle of a city Japan and Japan Summer time again [Laughter heard across the fields Marijuana haze I sit on your face lick it till I am dripping Guantanamo Bea No satisfaction Satisfying desires Only addiction Heavy eyes, dilate Sticked on the lines of your hand Nervously waiting The infant is passed Ned feet and small balled fists Galvanized barbs lurk Walking arm in arm Old elm branches interlaced Leaves fall, days shorten Another delete Now I write only the mods Does this pass muster? Long ago, first steps With you, I have traveled well Today let us dance Bathe your heart in warmth Shower your spirit with love Wash your hair with soap Fizzle in dawn light For love is only a fog Meaned to quickly burn Condoleeza Rice Bloodied my nipples and chest With her stilettos Totally useless I finish nothing, I start Even this stupid Listen to your heart Let it lead you through your life Dance to its rhythm Smelling of a fart It turns out it was a shart A simple mistake Haikus Haikus Haikus Hai Kus Haikus Haikus Haikus Haikus are my strength Another morning I come for cups of coffee Then I go to work Getting bumped aside Knocked down again and again Always standing up Uncleared within myself A slave to what I once was The indignity Help me push this rock In the deep green ocean We're both chained to it My collar itches I told you it was too tight I'll stay without it Life can be lonely Life can even be cruel That's pretty much it These past couple days I've seen your heart break in two He knows you loved him Two brothers dancing One goes left and one goes right They bump their noggins Puddles look like piss Near the apartments, I live They might as well be Yes, daddy, I cry Drool slips from my pouting lips I feel so little I've crunched the numbers I've ran the simulations My boredom is fact This bright summer day Fleeting taste of paradise A place in the sun Sometimes I get sad When my eyes get watery After a big sneeze Midsummer Sunset Pours into the ocean cove Bare skin bathed in gold Pushing causes pain Siezing in my narrow bones I think I'll lay down White cherry blossom Turning red and falling down Unexpected gift American Dream Longing for white picket fence This is a nightmare We are the stillness Of parked cars lining the streets In the dead of night As sharp as a blade The calm yet ferocious storm Hardens its resolve No amount of air Drunk surrounds me, my coffin Screaming is no help Here in the garden Let's play a game standing still Is the way to go? Baphomet lover Give me validation, please May I join your clique? Warm April breeze rolls Clothes on the line, bounce lightly Dancing with wind chimes Late night, little snacks They're the reason I'm so fat All night, I fridge check Three faces of self One you see and one love sees The last is all mine To my right, the waves And to my left cicadas Wreck summer night songs A piercing whistle Screams and thunderous applause Submit these sweat and tears Inside these four walls Dreams meander past the stars Quarantine musing Steaming hot water Filted through paper and beans Pourover coffee Laying on the couch Staring up at the ceiling Wishing you were here Seale a sugar moon When next I hear you breathing Until Mars has rings I also write raps It's all about play with words Around you like laps I'm tired of tears I deserve better than you She abandoned me She smiles in English I count my heartbeats in French Parley, vous anglais Shared between us two A frozen moment, a glance The world starts again White, gentle giants Transforming the vast blue sky Ever majestic I can't write Haikus They are very difficult Oh, wait, I just did How's your day going? Just saw a colleague's white briefs Funny zoom moments As I write, Haikus I always forget how to I use Jacksfilm's tune Mayonnaise is made Not from a spring or a stream Just made in heaven I miss the desert The long hikes and dry weather Day dreams of past days Singed trees ashen stumps Cancer across the valley A great erasure I hear her laughing I hear little splashes too Smartphone in bathroom Sorry, your bullshit Is not worth thinking about? Better things to do Love sprang in winter When it died, it was April Winter came once more From a dank basement A finger smeared by Cheetos Dispensenses, downvotes Rain clouds follow me Purse grey hues or thunderstorms The sun is still there Plant an idea Stirred up swarm of stinging bees Wage a holy war Winter afternoon Cold black coffee remembered A plane yawns above Victorious scream Pierces, what's left of your mind? Ease the steel heart Your love inside me Filling up an empty shell I feel whole again Monday, Dilema To stand on my own two feet Or to marry Rich My awesome office [Cupidle work everywhere] Always squeaky clean Vaude of all support My haiku falls in a pit Down the vote, you go [stairwell] So high up No matter how many steps Worth seeing the top I hate the sunshine It really depresses me I love cloudy days Promises are made Resentments in the making I just knew you would Creaking branches sway As I step along the path Shadows lurk behind Autumn chill outside I have to wake up early Just to smell fresh air My great great, great great great Great, great, great, great, great, great, great Grandfather had gills Great love lives so close The sky, the ocean, the earth You are not alone Leaves fall in the brook Circles of ripples widen Happily, Gurgles Haikus express pain Otherwise you'll never know Suffice in silence You are my bright sun Blinded when I stared too long I still seek your warmth One street with two names Runs through the city center End racism now The only thing left Is the music we both shared? Dear skinny love On lazy days off The slow turning of a leaf From green into brown Initials on trees Inside of imperfect hearts But that's what love is I am so angry This cheap mouthwash has left me Foaming at the mouth I'm losing myself Alcohol makes me rethink What do I feel now? I presumed them slow But over time I have learned We walk unlike paths Each moment surprise Time slips by and you fill it Perfect is your love And then it hit me Awful is the best there is Also a bullet Bright sparks everywhere Kindled passion for burning Ablaze so vibrant A founding father invented the lightning rod And bifocals too You ended your life I never even met you Now I deal with it A lonely petal Fluttering through the city Coloring the sky Adulthood engaged Childhood receded quickly Such was a tough time Don't fucking text her I mean, it do not text her Fuck, I texted her You will never know The depth and breadth of the mark You leave behind you Bounded by myself Been in prison for too long What to do once free? Outside sickness spreads You in your home, me in mine We connect through screens Big Buck is my name And Deer Hunter is my game Lend me a quarter Control comes within Restrain the raging, Malice Of young year's yearnings Sometimes I daydream Of the man I thought I'd be It's very foolish I retained a dream Many years of forgetting Hope for a replay Such perfect weather Thank you, Lord, for this moment A glimpse of heaven You're out protesting Over paint and your dark roots Confirm me out of it Locked up and retained A treasure long forgotten I hope to be freed She danced like water Clear, wild and timeless weaving Through the rugged earth Coronavirus Nature's callous, mighty Yawn I must shave today So why call my name? When I was the happiest Loner of us all No haikus exist About Tiger King till now This had to be fixed Eyes, gaze up at me His fingers about my hair So we are in dreams A year full of change The good, the bad, the ugly Two thousand twenty Dandelion clocks Faded tattoos and sweet tea I still remember Multiverse sooths me Always better, always worse Gives me perspective Push ups, sit ups, squats No machines, no weights, no friends Just isolation A corpse on the floor Self inflicted bullet wound This is a protest A small fishing boat Sways and swerves on the grim song Of Father Ocean Brushing ash off bone Half men crawl though bitter fields Glory, be the light Today is Monday I will be counting numbers The same on Tuesday I miss my best friend Need to hear your voice again Give my life for yours My birth was abrupt Even at sea, snow will fall If the time is ripe The dark closes in Enveloping the world in A blanket of peace Searching in the dark Yearning for lost connections My lonely bluetooth I thought it was grass But today, ah, white flowers What else need I know? All I love will die I will become old and poor And then I'll be gone I've lied to myself So I make this pledge to truth Later begins now A country so small Full of beauty and wonder I am in heaven A shell of blankets Keep me warm in the autumn Another cold day No tinder, no more No more loneliness in store No storms anymore Coffee at midnight No wonder I'm lacking sleep Fill me with regret When I close my eyes I can pretend I'm with her The girl of my dreams Oh, little flower Lift your head now, open up Time for you to bloom On the first Thursday Of each month in the summer They have free concerts He wants a wall built Purportedly for defense But that makes no sense Small in the air I have nowhere I can fly So please clip these wings Falling leaves, red brown Mini tornadoes rise up [ Chills face] And warms soul He walks through a field Lighter than a butterfly And the world trembles Action We're alone on the night beach To realize this kiss My birthday is close Thank you for being my mom I miss your meatloaf Was there no sentence? No words I could rearrange Nothing to save you Look, a petal falls From the flowers you gave me As they slowly die Bowing to power Unconscious crowd of pretence How ridiculous? Tasteless spaghetti Is it Olive Garden or? Coronavirus I am filled with rage Everything is maddening I cannot go on Clouds in autumn skies Drill like my sense of purpose I am fucking bored Don't pick up that bag It's contents won'tregister Until it's picked up I have to tell you A secret unknown to man I still do love you Becoming who you are For you do not need to change But accept yourself Stardust Formations From infinite directions View centers briefly The you that you lit Elluminated my world If only briefly The weeping roses Dishilar their beauty from light Not six feet apart Watermelon Seeds Becoming childhood projectiles Produced from produce Together again I swore I heard you saying The alarm bell rings Twenty seventeen Sexual harassment, meet Karma enough said I did not know then This ugly wrapping paper Would last for ten years Amber Horizon The lone swallow carves her path Refusing to fail Self healing takes time Learning and unlearning roles Much needed retreat Pop the molly yes Heart beats inside of my chest This feeling the best I awoke alive Yet absorbed with tiny things Wrens chirp in winter Traveling homewards My being could not refuse The pavement's embrace Pick up the pieces Put the puzzle together I am incomplete Wool over closed eyes Take off the sweaty blind fold I'm still not looking Tears have all been spent So the heavens cry for me Raindrops burn my cheeks This is the first spring That I have looked forward to All because of you I pen down my thoughts Pour all my emotions in Then I turn the page Five syllables here Seven syllables right here And there's five more here He who gave me life Hath returned to the cold ground Was it all my fault? Anorexia Starving for more than just food A sense of purpose Got a twist of Cain Yeah, it's just driving my brain From the god below Engaged for rapture Silent pray'rs on broken knees Let it be tonight If the Buddha laughs Is he really the Buddha? The laugh goes silent Have lived so many Lives in my mind, the real world No longer makes sense People gossiping To feel good about themselves 'Truly disgusting' Candles flickering Night falls upon the city The waiter arrives Your words to your loves Only with grace can I speak? Trouts of joy follow I did not date him His hair was very pretty Prettier than mine Toleration abound All people and things welcome Except for lactose I just want to die My lust for life won't oblige They call this living Celebrate what is Do not mourn for what is not Otherwise,suffer Morning kiss goodbye A fresh coffee warms my hands Cat prints on my car The shifting shadows Are coming for those you love? Let's both protect them Laguna, beach days Exotic, dreamlike waters Malicious sunsets Damn, what is that song? It's on the tip of my tongue Oh, shit, wait, it's gone Testing my resolve Transition takes me by storm What is the real world? Transitional states Think of them as a cocoon Emerge and fly high Great torrent and wind A grey summer storm blows in Flowers show no care What use do I have? What role do I have to fill? Makes me a bit sad You joined and we shared Blessed, were we in the moment? Thanks for your presence Some words kill people They can kill you from within Wonder what his were How dare you say that? See if I buy Bukowski From your dumbass now Sitting on a bench Joyous sunshine on my face Brave Robin Warbles Mother, don't worry The doctors were nice enough They just said I'm fucked What you envision? Is beyond who I can be? Please let me be me Find a hidey hole A place of peace and quiet So unlike my head My cat got outside Poor thing can't fend for itself Evolution's Proof The darkening sky Air becomes heavy and thick Downpours coming soon I woke up today Tired yet ready for life Each day, a struggle Separate dirt Pulling the clay from the earth? To make a new pot Oh, how wonderful A path beneath the tree tops While the spring rain talks That blowjob you gave Me while I was playing doom Was like Jesus Christ Growing old is hard To age is to outlive friends And mourn one more day Your words filled my heart In them, I found strength I need Enhanced to love A is for Apple I love to drink my snapple Skip Lady Chapel Three in the morning My body aching for him Resettling for dreams This shitty coffee The only thing I didn't miss Back to work at last You had a bad day A crazy little thing called Makes it all better Symptoms of despair A cry wish to end it all Don't give in, stay strong A teasing solstice Unveileding bare limbs with the Leaves fluttering off You are my goddess Moonlight on a perfect night Divine with beauty My hand on her chest I wanted to feel her heart But she slapped my face Ancient colossus Branchs stretch across the sky Tell me your story Trees stand for an age Cut down in prime lest decay Paper for writing Saints, please pray for us You found the one path of love Now we seek the same To those who do care World's Cross in Tomorrow's Sun The withering wind Find a sincere smile Feel peace and serenity Feast on Lexapro Sulking in my room Feeling sorry for myself Slowly moving on Mental health falters Once again, I am alone I have been ghosted Flashing bloody smiles Darkened my doorstep again Knocking never stops Worry about sleep Is interfering with sleep? Is that irony? Look, a petal falls From the flowers he gave her As they slowly die Green skin, curly tail Casting spells in the desert? Ah, a ham sand witch Lost girl in the woods Pathways of unknown origins The mazes of life Continually apart Relationship diverges Lonelyse befalls Anal sex is cool Give me that fat sexy ass I'mma insert dick As summer creeps in We dance in the fading light Moreing Summer's Death I'm walking outside People totally silent Wind whistles sweetly Lilac petals fall Leaving patio perfumed? Sip wine from last year He sits in his box Robert, the doll is his name Attention he craves They sneak out their tents And swim nude in the cool lake Fireflies blink and sway Remembering when? There were dreams for their own sake The pink elephant They fear the water Predators lurk down below Only the brave swim Flukes of red rain down Filling my thighs with the warmth Of a thousand suns We must not fear death All of us are meant to die Question is, how why? Why did I resist? Filled with grace, such joy in love Again today, please Words from me to you Words of faith, hope, life and love Words for you to share Temptuous and boundless Cones of sand are stuck midair Where was I again? My blood starts to boil Over something trivial Close my eyes and breathe First time I saw you Then feeling your energy Goosebumps on my skin I can't rap or rhyme But at least I have Haikus To express myself The heart of the home Constanting flat screens and A mantle remote Frantic little mice They waver in direction My mind runs with them I know you're afraid Let me earn your trust again There's too much to lose Sorry, I can't talk I know you're in bed with me I'm texting my friends Receding hairline Your retreat is preordained I watch helplessly You gave me cancer From you loving me too much I hope you die too I do not love you What I crave is affection Noa distraction An empty black cloak Riding a pale horse whispers Sweet release is near The wind blows gently Shakes the leaves in harmony Plays an empty song Early winter fog Envelops a neighborhood The burial shroud Such plush bedcovers The flicker of a candle Your clothes on the floor Sacrifice makes us crave A death we can't commit to No easy way out We stand on a hill Let's hope it's worth the journey Together we climb embers of anger Stoked constantly over time Never extinguished A shattered system Tear gas and burning buildings A broken nation Shooting my laser Stomping buildings feels squishy I am Godzilla Look at memes all day Time to stop there's more to life Dog pictures are next It's been a long day You could close your eyes right now Let it drift away Journaling is safe Unspoken thoughts on paper No one to judge me A dark, vast abyss I jump in with my eyes closed What a sensation I feel good today Calm content and in control I steer my ship now Words from the spirit Blessed with grace overflowing Your love for me, thanks Why are talking birds? Fascinating Donald Trump Knows to talk as well Darkness surrounds me It is also within me But I have no fear A cheeky haiku I have big aspirations World Domination Thin thread of kindness Twined and bound in girthy ropes Stowed on rusty ships Baby sleeps on me Peaceful, which makes me wonder Will she remember? Legend of Hyrule Sheathes the darkness with courage Wait, don't break that pot Common enemy Harbinger of Unity Watch the oceans rise The eagle soars high Master of all it surveys A breathtaking view It might be time to Ritualize an ending So I stop caring That blinking green light It is a drug dopamine In its purest form [Floating slowly down] Falling drifting deeper now Sleep and rest your crown Whoa is what I said? She's got that crazy booty Competition dead In Britain, it is In America, it's not Aluminium Time marches forward Healing slowly as it goes Let it be just be Floating in my room A nice twist behind her eyes Astronomy I say I love you Damn nocturnal emissions Should prove it to you How can I let go? When I still need air to breathe To feed thoughts of you I wander yet not All those who wander are lost I don't think I'm lost Waves have frequencies Space over time makes color Not so black and white A minimalist But if I had the money I'd have lots of stuff Frozen river thaws The birds and the bees return Her embrace awaits No cold air or tunes The spare is bald as a bat But hey, I like it Hash consumes all Much like a vast dark blanket Never letting go Thoughts swim like fishes A network of small mistakes I will rectify Dwindling delight A lost sense of sentiment Interruptive bliss Dousing flaming leaves Equinox, extinguishes The burning bushes Broods of brisk ripples Even little lakes glisten Sunlit cavorting A missive to jerks Life can be more fulfilling Open up your mind Death metal haiku You will all die in blood flame Bass guitar solo A cold winter night Gonesome window shadows of A couple dancing Humanities gift Art the bearings of one's soul This page is so great A match, if lucky Conversations go nowhere I started at all Endorsings beginnings Each day each season each year Loved you always Ripe Apple Orchards Falling leaves deep autumn reds Merge blossoms again Death in the desert The most beautiful boy falls Vultures love him so He read my haiku About kissing for chapstick? Now he steals mine too Green and purple buds Little bundles of heaven I want to smoke you Enough as hell Always trying to steal food Pooping everywhere Love is delicate Its beauty can fade away Like cherry blossom Axelling and throbbing I just want to close my eyes Lay my head and sleep If these walls could talk Wallpaper would get ripped down Or painted over? I just figured out I never get hostess gifts I bite off flowers Teachable moments You don't know when you're in 'em But they leave a mark Wilting sweet embers I want to live in your light Until he'll takes us Do you ever feel? Oversightly seclusion Not a soul replies Eight black moonlit crows In a field of railroad logs Scaning the bones A moment with you Is equal to real numbers? From zero to one Fresh, wet, heavy snow Fall quietly overnight This morning, no school Stepped over red flags Used them to cushion my knees And pray for a sign The snow is falling To give life in the new spring Frozen water gone Infiltrating thoughts Pause, empty the mind within Peacefulness returns Just floating with air Strike me and play with my strings Or too stiff, I burst If all the boomers Died from coronavirus Would it be so bad? Too much things you want But little actions have made Now go face your fear The temperatures drop Blue skies with breezy blown clouds Autumn's start crackles I love her so much Even though things just ended I still have regrets Human emotion Snip left and right in an app I yearn to be loved Sunset in the west Dig into my dreams tonight End the day smiling Traveled to Sydney To receive my new kidney Look, a Kangaroo Once we shared a song Now we shun the meeting place Now we sing alone A box fan rattles With no roar, I find no rest Don't you touch the plug? I am just a fool Shooting down my own success Fighting my own mind Grab a bit of town Westbound, the folks round the bend Turn and watch the rain Sleepless, Cicada Serenade me while I dream Trade a nightmare, please And what scares me most? That they do not act concerned For next election Tap, tap, tap again Bloodshot eyes and some coffee Tap, tap through the night And just like my dreams Failing reality Momentarily When one door closes Two more doors, slam in your face That's showbiz, baby Lilies in a vase Soft and smelling wonderful But not for too long You shine bright, my star My light in the dark child of A land far away I am but a ghost No shadow lays beneath me Only memories The term space is A Word diminished of meaning When we're holding hands I dream of drowning I feel no fear or sadness Only acceptance Delays, not again Emit mad tenet time, dam Again, not delayed Be ready to fly Head cocked little heart pounding The cat prowls below Your love is like a Sip of ice cold lemonade On a summer day Perched over the bay Railing splayed out like fingers Who put that curve there? Hit spots loved again Midnight skies, midnight sea streams Hit spots pain again This Thanksgiving day Don't say grace for what you have Think of the have nots Why yes, I believe Aliens contacted me Gave me news to share Step into darkness Ease an impulsive gut Trust brings clarity The end of Lungo Return to reality Might almost be safe The past may tempt you To dwell in and feel regret You got your karma I love you so much That I would endure burning Just to be your light We are not alone We are the whole universe It listens to us We are all broken shattered pieces everywhere Glistening in light The wind is still now Winter water drifts slowly Piling up silence He's a foolish man Who fells a beautiful tree? Just to count its rings Purpose singular The blossom spreads her petals The bees ignore her The rules are simple Stay away from the real world Protect the future My dreams disturb me Even the beautiful ones They fuck with my head Some stuck in Peru Some are stuck in Morocco They want to go home I wish this sub had A glossary of haiku Linked from the sidebar Inspiration grows Until bursting at the seams Infinity plus The first few rain drops Sizzle on the parched asphalt Urban Petrichor Good morning, my dear The clouds will make a great frame For your lovely smile I live a lame life One who's meaning has been lost I hope it ends soon The grass grows taller We are born, we live, we die And the grass gets cut A haiku for lost Souls, if you don't know what to Do do the dishes A badge of brutal Blue curtains are drawn on the Police behavior Boased of Qurantine? I can't wait to go outside When will that day come? Cracked skin strums the steel Freeing tunes you held for long Brings you rhythmic joy Three in the morning Droking traffic pollution versus the night sounds No one hears you, yell Deep within the void of space We are abandoned Sometimes you need it Melancholy and slower Just a song sung blue Love you, Mary Jane You are my favorite thing Fuck baby, Yoda It's ma'am you bigot Dude, I'm mental over here Change your norms for me Frustration building The world is not a fine place Darkness takes over The world not at war Clean air and water for all This is paradise Bucks and footsteps Are the Thangs dat he doin'? That's Tamazius Wrong memories Sadden me with happiness From long, long ago The clouds cast shadows In the garden where we danced When I think of you This morning I heard Your song, your voice in my head A broken record Scrub til hands are raw Isopropyl keys and phone? This is normal now Across wintry rocks Froze in a heartbeat's distance A stag's crow eyes flare Summer is ending Like, dandelions in the Wind, we drift away Many rows of teeth Great hunters of the ocean Sharks are very cool I did a haiku Five syllables on my hand Then seven, then five Twenty four hours Nikotin withdrawal pains I have just begun Like hands of a child Tiny tracks in the first snow Looking for a snack? Words have such power One can condense the cosmos In a haiku There will come a day When the last bridge collapses Yet the river flows A student bends low Cherry blossoms overhead Penny on the ground Less fear of sharks Curbing creatures of the deep You have my respect Wrived like an old wheel Rolls along like a river But seldom it roars Spring and the past life A forest of memories An endless cycle Goblins in my skin Haiku'so hard it hurts me I cried and wrote this The lineman hooked A Role and hung by a thread to Repair his webbing On nights like tonight Lonelyness, crowds in so close Wish you felt the same Crimson Red Above Bier sting to your nostrils All hope is restored Slowly undressing Pretty garments falling down Just a stem remains Ocean swells fiercely Waves crashing against the cliffs The cliffs cannot last Potato tacos A tasty and filling lunch I want a repeat Listen with intent To sounds between the silence Melody is born The unknown scares me No way to truly prepare That's why death scares me I have a good boy I wish he was still with me I miss my good boy An empty haiku Short and incomplete story Writen without care Night time is lonely Lost calls from a duck in spring His wife has been caught Dreams are shy creatures The morning call is dreadful One more minute, please I may not wait more Pressing deadline due right now Hurry up and eat Sharp intake of breath Eyes wild like a rearing horse Who canceled Netflix? [Rhythm and meter] Grace and strength given to those Who prefer neither? Ponytail holders Sitting in the summer sun Why do I do this?

Cards against humanity We're going to hell Words yield great power One can condense the cosmos In a haiku Like a blunt pencil I need you to sharpen me But the lead shatters Feel the burning sun Smell the hot frangipani Taste the trickling sweat Try to be yourself I advise them not knowing What a mirror is Keep your eyes covered My mother's comforting voice Shrieks, but I don't peek At times, nothin works Everything that can goes wrong I dream of the end Today was special It was time to level up Someday I may win Serial killer Of conversations, friendships And relationships We know so many Different faces of friends Yet we know little The rain hurts my heart Let me see my beautiful My darling sunshine Who's ready to teach?

In a world full of crazy Not for us to know Heavenly embrace Gentlemen, you tug at my clothes Caress of the wind In the willow tree Young lovers hide in secret Between the branches Fear breathes on my neck Hands on the wheel, cataracts Bloom and eat the road We walked for ages Looking for a better home We yearned for the end Who is this woman? She has been here all along Waiting to be heard Red behind blue eyes My deadly waning gibbous Life goes on and on The cold, bitter wind That cuts straight through to the bone Also stokes the flame My soft skin opens Draws you in earns your trust and Then swallows you up When will I see you? I open my eyes,it's you Forever, are we? I give thee no fucks There's not even one for me No fucks to be seen I want to be numb Or maybe just forgetful What was I saying? In a Rusted town Wweeds entomb old rail road tracks New Necropolis Creative outlets Turn in to express outward What do I look for?

There is no taking them back The tongue holds power Pop the champagne flows Confetti of emotions Bubbles mix with blood Always on my mind Your scent, your smile, your hands, you I want to hold you I have a problem All my comments are Haiku's Please send help post Haste A vowel dwelling And a scrubby consonant Spelling out sparrows Beautiful night sky Like an oil spill caught ablaze Beauty is tragic Splash your emotions For just ten seconds a day And live hollowly Really wanna poop Coming out of my rectum Clenching really hard Mouth from workday The air tonight speaks of rain Tomorrow morning Out of the fire But into the frying pan Will this ever change? Dark days loom longer Time will reveal the answers Pasure is the key The past isn't all bright Black pages should be read too Who says Gray's boring?

Same thing we do everyday I miss working shows Rise high enough and The stars will cease to twinkle As it is in life Fuckin'with the groove On my Sunday afternoon These dog barking blues I married Swollen Filled with my very first love Brown haired, green eyed boy Behind the closed doors A most unspeakable crime The animals cry Those glimmering eyes Want me to be a sinner? I'll sin not with you Winter is coming Make fun times and memories With reddit, of course Hard times, lie ahead Hopes and dreams crumble to dust Leaving deep despair Traveling abroad? Different places and foods I can't wait to go Your life in the void Written as it's told by Pi So many questions? Even when I smile My true face behind this mask The one thing you see A realm of wonder So much beauty to behold A whole life ahead Tray's edge unsheathed Slowly, logic starts to fade I'll just have one more Anxiety grips Racing heart into danger Reality bends As the sunlight fades Comforting darkness flows in With the scent of rain Noticeably numb Vibrational colours now seem dull Here we go again You take my order But what about you today?

My words crest and fall Like waves upon the shoreline In truth they're whale farts Choose words carefully Journal quips, said in sorrow May open new wounds Staring at the clock Waiting for the workday's end What a waste of life I don't know the rules The Haiku is the title I guess I'm sorry A wizard, Fortold I will meet my one great love Maybe it was him Two flags, one nation What an abomination? Need a salvation On that day, you said Never fall in love with you You told me too late Day two of Haiku A simple stress reliever Get my brain going Greetings to you all This seems to be a great place I found a new home A safe without key So too many memories For security Then head over heels Conclusion: No concussion Though two fucked up feet Chalk on the blackboard Eyes focussed only on her Serendipity A world framed in glass Robbing senses of their worth Giving sadness breath I am a retard At least I am not alone We all bought Gamestop Her blue bucket hat Keeps her cool in winter sun Far too cool for me Pithy words abound How could this happen to us? You reap what you sow A brief encounter Like a warm midsummer night On a November Rhydon used earthquake It was super effective Pikachu fainted If you put the whole Cookie in your mouth at once You make fat, less crumbs A slide thick with leaves Children locked safely inside Jumping from the couch? Love lasts in patients Let dark scars and placid play Come home to me soon The virus riots Deaths of legends and fires This year's been decades Autumn chill morning I have to wake up early Just to smell fresh air Constant temptation Only with grace, I resist God perfecting me Rain freezing quickly Branch's overburdened break Scalling to the ground If you love someone Set them free, they may return Like a moth to flame Winning my future But instead of committing I worship the haze I cut down the wood I got splinters on my hands This house is a home The stinging is fine We must make friends with the pain And fight through today With the setting sun I too fall into slumber Stressful, restless sleep Tie string to my head Keep me from drifting away Fow clouds lift my mind I just had it here But it decided to leave Where is my damn pen? The lack of sleep peels Layers of your mind away Raw subconscious thoughts Eyes open slowly A vague form lays beside me Where now are my pants?

Challenged yourself Determined to go forward One step at a time The journey begins A grand quest to mow a lawn One man and his bike Sunny winter morn [Muses away] Yesterday's fun Someone lost a glove Harrious words burst forth pain Flashing from my heart, they were A lesson for me Monday morning, Blues Another bus passes by Late to work again Divorce is the price Half pay, so we all can dare To believe in love Cyclone from nowhere With a terrifying name Bombogenesis Heated deep within In stillness, dark lady weeps She once had a soul Volcanic temptress Blowing kisses of dark ash Beckon, me closer Give thanks for today For you can eat all you want And not feel guilty In between spaces An awareness of silence Listen in presence No eggs nor his hat Read across America Has cancelled the cat The eyes of a cat Be it love or agression Always look the same Company for Mars Shades of red fill the night sky Blood moon on the rise Suck, start a shotgun Much thicker than a milkshake A forbidden treat A few thousand bees Vomited drops of nectar For your banana Smoking cigarettes? Addictioning and destructive Like you were to me I love you like words Want to be spoken yet still? Long to be whispered Three cold, hard boulders Scuffed by wind and rain and sand Protect a tortoise Watch the Earth decline At the point of no return Gaze new beginnings Roses from a seed Peapers flowing in the wind Beauty of flowers I wish I could live In the glimpses of myself I saw in your eyes Day by day, you love My Lord, step by step, you lead How awesome you are I age in mirrors Remembers and fears stir my soul [ clocks] Never rewind Drifting morning fog Rivulets gather and wash Over broken trees Said you needed space 'Cause you hated the distance Now we're just distant Democracy is Rarely practiced in lifeboats Real or imagined This ain't a haiku Though it follows the format That happened by chance To consume the earth Seemed impossible until I unhinged my jaw Hitting the plain truth You control the narrative Making sins vanish Always love for us The gifts and graces we need Each stroke perfects us What does not kill you? Will still haunt you afterwards But they will soon fade Vaguely familiar Another boring birthday Not much you can do Why has it taken? So long to do in a word Procrastination Uh, oh, trouble now Haiku police will show how Writing should be wow Rainy Saturday Coffee break to ease the hurt Fraternal solitude I have often thought Of friends who drifted away Now I fight the breeze I wish I had friends Then I would not write Haikus In my room alone She, the huntress, strikes In a flash, her prey is won Ninja in darkness How long shall I wait? As the time stands still for me Seasons come and go Recently bought plants Green serenity at last Can't wait to kill you My eyelids, a dam Ready to flood the cities I cannot hold it Moonrise claims the sky A rebirth seizing the day Overflowing light The ground is thawing I hear the birds singing songs Come alive, it's time Woof woof heard the man? Had it not came from a babe? He may have heard Wolf The blades keep turning Staring up while the clock ticks Cage made of drywall So sure of yourself If you act without hindsight Guilt will consume you Hands grasping their neck Scooping until there's no air I did this for you The morning sunshine With you gently by my side Red streaks in the air Tonight, no TV Perhaps I'll be a poet It could set me free The X marks the spot No guide, no topography Bad cartography Divorce the big D How did we lose each other? We really screwed up Insipid scuttles Over floors of empty lots These leaves are zombies The summertime breeze Resurfaces memories That I never had After me made love We laid together in bliss Under peaceful snow Pasure is the key They say, but God I'm waiting Been here for ages A calm mind, shatters A voice rumbles in my brain Mouths move in silence I am full of fear I start things I can give up Not things that matter Pour in the city The smell of heated asphalt Between the raindrops My anus quivers Faggoted virginity Taken by niggers Rightful and yet wrong Proud and yet miserable It all goes away Saffron rose petals Twice on journal pages Blue ink afternoon It's been a long time Since I posted a haiku Maybe tomorrow The archer takes aim A blue eye through thin crosshairs Fruit succumbs to steel The damaged car and Attempts to resuscitate Both were towed for parts My favourite chore During frosty weather is Feeting chickadees She saw my first breath But now I have seen her last I miss great grandma Minds playing cursive Spiral down like a staircase But to what extreme? Humbles before me So many stop now, never Grace is all I need Adrift in wonders As life passes before me Hath, I enjoyed it Come holy spirit Perfect for us is your grace Love, never ending Steamy, dark liquid Lucidity in the fog Morning is for us Dusty afternoon Coffee, rice and toasted bread I miss you, Nana No color, the same But under the moon and stars We all wear midnight Do not stand or sit The rope creeks as it tightens Slippers hit the floor I want to go home The only place I feel safe The warmth of his arms Nobuyuki plays The gods stop to watch and cry The blind pianist If you want to speak With special authority Show special talent Goddam creaky doors How many of you are there? In this effing house Awaken is the world In bed, we stay locked, embrace Dreamers endlessly A loss of control Oversightly sensation Nothing but regret Twirling yellow leaves The crisp air bellows through trees Orange mosaic The past is haunting Help release me from this curse Then love can blossom I imagine us As sea otters holding hands To not drift apart Why did I sell out? Giving my gifts to strangers It should have been you Love, shared glory Love bonds even in darkness Love is all we need Cold anvil of grief My aching arms carry you While my love runs free I could nudge you now But then you might awaken Keep snoring my love A kiss for your brow My lips brush so close to yours Good morning, my love A sweet, salty treat But man makes me so thirsty No water, so blood I like things meta And I also like Haikus Guess I'll merge the two You need to tell me Even though I know it all And I know you do Time is like water But so is everything else Could drown you some day Holidays alone If only I could be numb I do not exist This day is unwell Terrifying sensation The sweats and fever The sun shines above My son's rolling in the grass I seek the cool shade Planning my escape? To where the grass is greener One step at a time A catty remark Sniped across the heart, leaving A razor sharp sting Legend of Zelda Link's awakening is just The absolute best He hid like she did A mirror to her facade It was unpleasant Caught in a corner The paper tablecloth whirls Practiceing its dance Seven deadly sins Could it really hurt that much? To commit just one If the sun should set On all we have ever been I had the best day A beautiful soul Comes from the most damaged heart By Newton's third law The ball is missing The kids no longer will play Roofcomplains the dog A ruby sunset Another day fades to dark Dawn will come in time All are resting now Retching cuts the night again No sleep, poor baby [Messages lightning] Pails of tears spill eyes glisten [whispers] Fake Arrows Most beautiful rose Stem decorated in thorns For you, I'd strip bare Past me is a dick He ruined my present life Man, just screw that guy Trees break for winter Tender heart aches for your love Old branches, splinter She said I like you But the answer was silence Big, empty silence Fingers flick and fly Others care, but I do not Nothing matters bliss We've become distant Sharing something may fix this Perhaps morning would This girl is thirsty And it is starting to show It's not a good look Your musky juices Running down my chin and then? Dripping on my chest Child, we never met For a time you were there,Joy Now embraced by God I have a problem I just want to write Haikus About the mothman? Howling North Winds blow?

Eternal regret It's true we all lie When I'm honest with myself I can never tell Boaling grey work life Some of the events are cool Same music each day Unworthy, am I? How you love me perfectly? Ever loving you? Sensibility of déjà vu As if this happened before And might yet again Perception holds weight Perhaps a bit too heavy Internal turmoil I don't mind living It's all gonna be fleeting Might as well dig in Drinking black coffee? Sweet bliss on my pinkish lips Ah, the little things Near the toppled chair A basket of fresh cherries Never chew on pits Smoking the best green I have never been so high Relaxing on couch This rope will be nice The refined dime winter ice I hope I can die Leaves are falling down [whispers of a frozen age] Winter is coming I bow to my heart Who waited so patiently? For me to arrive Angler of my heart I don't mind suffocating Hanging on your line Tears falling on stone A widow weeps bitterly Love lost forever The day spent dreaming My progress remains stagnant Get to work, dumbass Creating deceit These people thrive in the dark With flying monkeys Command me my queen Body, you simple vessel Waiting yours to fill When will you learn when? Will you learn that your actions? Have consequences The word of silence Unspoken yet, bellowing [whispers] Quell its voice With closed eyes inhale Young again in nighttime air Yet, exhale, we must Reechoes of the past I will not pull this trigger Time to be silent Streep autumn breeze blows Through the trees, knocking off leaves For me to play in Beware, Mastery Nothing known is ever known Truth's a visitor You have been the strength Sit with me and rest a while You are protected Cricket's in the dark Sing among themselves all night A sweet harmony Medium of thoughts Language bridges mine to yours Arrangement First, sweet fruit of spring Sweet red berries, seeds outside Taste nothing like straw I see you often There with me there when I sleep It was just a dream Herds of the undead Doing their gray decayed flesh Wanting my fresh brain? Soda, pop for one Worry your thoughts with my wisdom Air bubbles top sides Your will be done, Lord Faith, hope placed only in you I choose you always A little spider Moves back and forth on its web Playing with the light You should have some fries I like to consume with dips Normally, ketchup I held leaves and grass Soft, humid and freshly cut Does it feel like life? Phantastic Conceptualisation Creativity Sweet birdsong sunshine Steam rises from cup of tea Here I sit at peace Droplets of water Do not know the sea exist Ignorance is bliss To you, you roamer Be happier there instead Live in that sweet bliss Dust on the old road The scent of fallen apples Autumn leaves me too Lakes evaporate Remember, rain houses shrink Where do the fish go? An observation The things I try to avoid They are the real tests Sleeping gossamer? Corner of my eye, it haunts You're gone but still here Sleep or not to sleep Romeo just had to ask Sleep is for the weak More than flesh and bone An entity of passion Yet all too human An unused blade rusts Resistent practice, passion Maintains its sharpness The bow cuts through froth An angry blade breaking waves A humpback follows Camping for the night A sleeping bag leaf with A Spider sewn inside Sitting on a bench I share my heart with the ducks Quack, quack, quack, thanks ducks Hope for President But instead we keep the queen Such dark time ahead The teenager says You do not understand me They are ridiculed He pulls at my strings This shadowy puppeteer Forever pulling Warm body, cold mind That travels through space and time Vehicle driver Behold this prophecy We're all destined for greatness Learn to know thyself 'A pig or a dog' My thought on first seeing you Now your snores mean home It strikes me as odd Knowing I'm part of nature Watching the leaves change Love in your eyes, friend There we touched, embraced and loved Closed now,remembrance Bossy barrels and Supervising signals are Managing the drive I know you're wicked But each drag's a sweet reprieve I'll quit tomorrow A haiku writer Grad student who runs for fun Loves to read good books Sonshine filled my day Your joy, love and gifts for me All I ever need A short summer's storm Wintry rain falls on my face I do not feel it Take my ship tonight Heart on an expedition Battered on the rocks No, Waluigi We wanted Waluigi Damn it, Nintino Simmering sunset Slowly seasons, salty seas Sandy Shores sing songs Drunk eyes looked back To a magical moment Devoid of regrets Biggest ball of fur Energy like no other Gimme, a hug, mate Your sorrow and grief Has overtaken your heart? But I'll stand with you Seeds need help to grow Feer can be driven away All it takes is time Stop falling in love It is not good for the soul Lonelysing is God Everyone is wrong I am the only sane man Which means I am not Be kind to my heart It's been wounded in battle Far too many times I am better now Still have lots of big problems I'm bigger than them Splashing words from Murk reveals your self expression Missuse of language Beat your worn war drum Merit up the courage to Continue ahead Constant sand falling Leisurely burying me Can't seem to climb out No funeral, please Pretend like I was never Even here at all How painful it is? To have loved and to not have Lost it all just some Life is meaningless But so is the rest, I guess We might as well live I'll take any love The couch you lay on at night Wanted but just used An old woman sings A lullaby in the spring Alas thunder growls In the hospital I wish you knew who I am I love you, Mommy They say love yourself You deserve a love that heals Self love is hard work Those empty spaces By your absence long ago We're filled, life goes on Melancholia Restless agony plagues me Comfort eludes me Don't be too afraid To speak with superiors Don't give them power At the rider's roost Where Connie cannot be found? Fancy sheds for sleep Deep in the attic Baby dolls go there to die [whispering] Mama We laugh holding hands As the ocean runs away On the train ride home Shiny frozen lake Life suspended under ice Will return in spring Slow dancing shadows [whispering] In the moonlight Serenity's veil The new flowers bud Spring smiles fondly on new growth Summer days nearby [shakespeare] has no words For our affection bloomed Through cold winter days Here I am screaming The forest quivers and wakes Downed the birds fly by Rain, clouds, but no rain Promises of affection Dry grass underfoot Paper pen and hand Come together to save me This my religion Dubious tumblr girl I like your septum piercing And your lack of thoughts Try meditation Maybe some vitamin D Add to cart, buy now Enough litter box [Mocks] My waiting open heart Need some cat poop now? I just write Haikus As I lack the energy For anything else? 'Alse i sit here Just twiddling aimlessly With no end in sight A dank earthen breeze Speaks of buried rusted rot Long since forgotten Turn back says the world Love yourself is the message I choose to love you Past thoughts and musings Now overcome by events Erased forever Nowadays we're dams We're all gonna burst at once Try turn on a tap The oak leaves I haunt Listen to me whispering A long gone dead chant A violin sound A white blanket of snow falls A worm cozy shed Little droplets fell Wired away by the next drop All impermanent Beautiful creature Quietly stands in the dark Waiting for its prey I suck at Haikus Do you have any advice? Thank you in advance Her prerogative Changed a lacey dress into Pinging beads of ice Lincoln got shot dead Old Washington never lied Who were the others? I did fall in love Expecting her to catch me But I hit the ground Be humble in life Look up to the sky and see See how small you are A bend in the road The tombstones of lumbered trees Litch the hillside Caranda's bloom Can you see from your window? Itchy ears miss you Lambs watch in silence The dead cannot scream for us India's burning Life is a journey Through the wilderness to get To the other side Poetry is what? If the word order matters Forget about it Sometimes stomach cramps Mean only one thing to me Distribe, pain Like a waterfall 'Cause infinite ripples And rainbow colors Came into this world Out of Mother's Vagina And never looked back Iconic spring wind gusts Mirrors, emptiness inside Trouts and limbs shiver An ode to the spleen Dutifully filtering Lymphocytes are made It's scary in here I don't like any of this What are these monsters? Ease all Buddhas Resist the artificial Dissolve your ego Ablaze like the sun Hidden by the shadow moon Raidiant, but dark A dream about you Flashing by like lightening Leaves me emptier What I failed to do Haunts me, drags me downdarkness Love brightens my day Now that my minds blank Probably the perfect time For this old bullshit Fingers run through hair She enjoys when I do that Go deeper, baby Fall day's warmth recedes Your presence warms my soul, Lord You knock enter, please His body withstood Dropping degrees while smiling With his charcoal teeth Bag of happiness Sunshine on a cloudy day Temptanally Conversation,love Hearts and minds connectedjoy A taste of heaven Houses in a row Wind Chimes singing out of tune Quiet little street Drops held by a branch They cling, but fall on my head The trees are crying First, ripe fruit of spring Sweet red berries, seeds outside Taste nothing like straw Beyond Antares The skies are green and glowing My heart is waiting Ass is in the air I have no choice but to stare Because it's right there The devil is real He lives in the narcissist Run towards the light Your help at each turn Always just what I need, Lord Oh, how I love you New tech, good impact Central air forced air heating Who is my neighbor? I wanted to stay Love service called me away Perhaps tomorrow This is my first post Am I doing this thing right? I really hope so She shit on my dick I told her no taco bell I need a shower A little black bird Frozen under dirty snow Mom forgot my name Now, may be okay Could you imagine the fun? Living in the past Laying here with you You have a type of silence That makes me feel safe Must resist the urge To write another haiku Here I go again Been here for ages The beauty of cold showers They never run out Two months on the hunt No results soon, I could starve God, please hire me When I read Haikus I will read it with a tune From news in Haikus Hot and restless nights A warm breeze through the window Misery lives here Over or along You cannot avoid the tracks Choose your direction A great flash of light Everything we knew is gone The Gamma Ray bursts If you get to where? You can't take it anymore Then it's time to give Neonlight above Eating noodles in the rain Steam flowing upwards Awesome, is your love? Always present for us all Tears for you, my love Darkness in my soul The want of light in my mind Fighting the shadows Scurry in the road Shiny eyes in a trashcan I have found a friend Ah, the deadly blues They enter my life as you Exit it for him Two dimming lanterns The river flows more slowly One last gust of wind A blue outgrowth grows Out of the blue sky above A shrubland of glass Key details, whisper Still, minds can hear beating hearts Listen more, talk less The goal of each line Remember nature and mind Haiku therapy You know when she's born? The first heart your daughter breaks Will, of course, be yours Eagles spread their wings Soaring past the horizon Until the sun sets I just remembered Something I said years ago Now I hate myself Right now I am drunk Drinking with friends brings me joy Shame I am alone Everything is closed It's illegal to go out Oh, no, I feel sick Sweats in summer nights Lights out to keep them away The Flying termites Solitary thoughts Dreams of a life in tatters A life's quiet end Considering Rap Try keeping an open mind Haikus can be trap Heaven opens up Rivers bloat and burst their banks The village consumed I don't like Reddit It has weird, weird people there Who like bread on trees? Gonesome Horizon Sun emerges from the trees Elating the birds Sometimes I drift off Thinking of your smiling face? That's my happy place First sip of coffee Awakens your dreamy eyes To face the real world Silence in the night Lightning, thunder in the mind She makes it quiet YouTube video Glasses boy with violin Won't you notice me? Breath in the fresh air Crisp and cool spring is now here Bright, rosy red cheeks Brave cyber bullies Keystrokes of yellow behind Autonomous screens I feel so enraged I can't draw the way I want Thanks, Microsoft Paint Longing for her touch Stricting a picture of them Taken years ago We were like brothers I was to always be there Though I have failed you Ugh, I'm so tired Just enough strength for Reddit Au revoir bedtime May grass grow plenty On the path, you might tread least So I know you're home I am very sad Saved you the exotic text Thanks for listening She wants him to change He wants her the way she was Their love fades away My husband says that I'm the coolest hottie with The hottest coolie Words like water drip Pure raindrops in a vessel Splashing syllables Dawn draws nearer on You must bear the bright armor Awaken from sleep Venting through and through Sabotages and murders I'm the imposter Truthful to the Lord Underpass dreams unspoken I want a frosty Fast, all out cleanup If it ever comes to it The end to all war Back where I started As if I never got there No time, just amber Numerous faces Marijuana fills the air My guitar is flat Toyota, yaris A small economy car Why am I obsessed? The water like glass I look into the mirror Age stares back at me The seasons will change Fall, spring, summer and winter A breath of fresh air Eternal music Blowing through the dark forest Never to be heard Broken and on your own WASHING on Saturday night Life as a student The room is all black Insomnia crashes in The loudest darkness I was the asshole Who told you what I wanted? But we both don't know Ever nomadic? Bonds made and broken often I begin again Chemical numbness Kidneys expel happiness Moreing the sunrise Marcello, my friend Golden God in black and white Yes, Mastriani You deserve better I do not deserve your love For I loathe myself At last some free time Lord of the Rings Marathon Fat, kiefy bowl packs While others count sheep I exhausted, but sleepless Count the syllables Loveless and alone Perverts raise the sea level All full of white foam A bright new day dawns The coasts of Japan sparkle She makes her own path Fear of rejection Relief in your acceptance My secret is told Cruel afflictions Pain that won't leave when you go Glad you are gone, tho I like Tequila This should be on the drunk sub Because I am drunk Swim upstream, cold flow Faster strokes for moving on Give it all dye red Factors remain unchanged When called by another name? A cage is a cage Create new freedoms Only in America Targets of new law Little monsters come Mounds of candy, piling high [Laughter] In the night Amalgamation A mix of man and metal Move mound and mountain Today you told me That you and I are the same We share the same soul The wind and the rain Grey clouds that slowly pass by Enjoying some tea Beginner white belt The path is never ending Beginner black belt Thoughts you send to God? Have never left your ape skull It's time to grow up Where are my stories? Grudging through a life, not mine Life, why can't you start? My toes and fingers Cold as midnight, betrayal Unfurl in summer Stepped on a golf ball Just now fuck me Jesus Christ Thank God I don't bowl What shall this child be? Once was asked of you and me Love is the answer The most silent nights Adrift and frozen in sleep Slumbering beauty Morning rays, warm skin I am the golden sunlight But also the blue Marmorized clouds above Frosty Earth and fresh cool air Breathing in and out Dew on, gossamer Silver in the moonlit night Waiting silent still Neither said a word Sat picking morning, glories Down by the courthouse Roots that spine the curb Streetsides turn back to nature Dehumanizing Hot steam fogs the glass Dancing leaves, move up and down Clear water now dark Transfer of matter Something dies as we grow old Replaced by something Waste politics Just delete and make it clean My haiku pristine A personal goal Do no harm, but take no shit And this is the way I hit rock bottom Wind whispers through the river Your kayaking sucks Speaking quietly Sometimes wiping away tears Old men talk of war A good night of sleep Will heal many of my wounds The gift of shut eye Snow the mountain's crown Cloak of dusk about her feet Incensed with wood smoke The House of Horrors Where a deathly demon dwells? Born without her horns A cold wind this day Breath of God warmed body soul Life is worth living Haiku to show you The most relevant lines first We have sorted this Glistening, starlight In a field alone with you You fill it with love If there is only One love lost among billions Then we are all doomed Approach a brick wall Confirmed you can scale it What if you cannot? Through the spilled ink and Overused words I try to Make sense of my thoughts What is a haiku? A smile for me one for you It is happiness Bang muzzle flashes An accidental discharge Tale of conception Know who rules the world? Probably not who you think Illuminati Dear little flower Lift your head now, open up It's time to blossom What if I was done? With lists, rides, graces and meals And it disappeared Out of the blue, you Got in touch to say hello But left soon after Dripping endlessly I count each drop ignoring The pool beneath me The last airbender Thanks for this blessing, Netflix Helps out quarantine I lay on my bed Hopping to dream peacefully But I'm so awake Earlier sunsets Summer draws out it's last breath Autumn's scowl daunts me Just had some starbucks Imminent diarrhea God, what have I done? Autumn Standard Time Gives me momentary blues Dark sky comes too fast On a day like this Lost you in a deep abyss Fuck days like today Listen to me, please And when you are done talking Hear me then again Trees freezing, lose leaves But in springtime they renew Maybe I can, too Morning birds chirping I sit in my gilded cage A pandemic life Sometimes when you lose Everything you come to gain More than what you had How am I today?

Particles stop fellowship Death puppets, weak steps What is a shower? A hot chemical cocktail For you to get clean The gamer ponders Is it summer already? Onwards to his fall Steering past the signs blurred lines and blind spots can wait Time split like lightning Hot gust envelops Dry leaves, natural tinder Billows of smoke rise Hometown funeral Driving home a railroad wreck? Something in common Borodom strikes, time lost Freedom comes with love service Hope and joy with you Beat it, just beat it Red leather zipper jacket What was with the glove? The sun glows brightly Filling vacant space between Winter's dead branches I am a robot A soulless automaton Forever alone A secret garden Wind whispers serenity My soul is peaceful Unquestionably Never doubt my heart on this Yes, black lives matter First, melt the sugar Then add the butter and cream Oh, sweet caramel [ thick layers] thin lines Human and tree spirit maps Death reveals the past The people you hate Are the enemies of those? Who taught you to hate? Rain was coming down Happiness and joy no more Then you come along A spider runs by Another innocent soul My foot comes down hard A rising tide swells A wave that sweeps all under The perfect punchline The snow fills the gap Between pines and the warm sun You are the cold snow The night's upon us But while you sleep, I must work Always with my thoughts Favourite warm waves When you are near, I can't speak Will you hurt me too? Aversed all hope Life seems like a blur right now Might be from the tears A whispering wind Sheltered from the savage storm My heart stays with you Cat is sick again What fresh new disease awaits? He is immortal Unforgiving streets Precinct your gentle embrace A break in the clouds A spark on Snapchat Will it exist in person? I hope we find out I write them all here Because I lack the courage In that other life Cinco de Mayo My brain explodes in my head Why did I drink that? Little frog in grass I hide too from taxes, but The mower still comes Gentle rain falling Upon my protective roof Sleep comes easily She held my face and She sang the part of the song That explained her heart Your heart I reach for Only you can let me in Please let down your walls In the looking glass Seasons appear as one form None are, as they seem May drinking and smoke Bury my heart, six feet deep Let time fill the hole The brave little frog Spiked quickly across the road Hop hop hop hop, squish Blue mottled with black [ thick clouds] Clot above concrete Right eye swollen shut All aboard the train A message from the driver My life is off track Your kids are at risk Trust fund baby Donald Trump Liar, coward, Prick I would die for you And the beautiful thing is You would never ask I am alive as A miracle of nature As is everything Broken umbrella Sprews from a metal trash bin [Whispering] Azaleas Hallucinogens Sexual accessories Saturday night, love Mouths open to speak And ears ready to listen The school year begins A whisper of me My shadow forever gone Memories all fade Your reality The moment your eyes opened Is the universe? Something very deep This haiku is meaningless Stop being edgy Ain't got nuthin fresh I rely on fart jokes now The duck ran that way It is so empty The sky has nothing special Yet so beautiful Are you exhausted? No, everything is alright He was not alright Monochromy blends Days like seconds slip away Never slowing down Stardust for breakfast Spicy galaxies at night Dancing in the light To know tragedy And the strongest joy is to Obsess over love I loved you in the Old world, and I will love you In the new world blink I tried on my mask My mom made it by herself Once curtain fabric Albums of Old Love Pictures of babies and trips Where is my scrapbook? Barcen blue skies, woe What's it like to be alive? The shy dim stars woe The hamper is full Washing from dryer is warm Are these all my socks? The harvest moon shines Let's go plant some tomatoes And find me a wife I remember you Face widened by summer joy Something in my eye A silent, dark night Dew drops rest on leaves waiting For a trip to Sky Karma is a bitch But only if I insist On provoking her Words cheap in value Deed's accomplishments treasured Do more than say more The leaking tap fills A droplet to let go of Another tear falls You claim to love Christ But forgot to ask yourself If he would approve Headphones on my ears To silence all the voices Thank God for music Terrence oh terrence You and catastrophism Could just be the key History may rhyme Some of the verses are known Only after death A supernova Brings the dark night sky to life Dead a thousand years Desolate city Overgrown trees that waver Just an enigma Brief meditation Deep breaths and judgeless thoughts flow I am here and now Forgive me, my friend I cannot help you today I must help myself Listen to the rain Hear the stories of the world Often left untold Just simple darkness Water drips off my body Missing myself Routine continues Weeks on and day after day Give me something new Rain, clouds and sunshine Arcs of colour through the sky She's my pot of gold An alarm ringing A child given an award My dreams have been lost Vultures so hungry It is the circle of life What makes your flesh great?

Meaningless haiku Layered sparsely with meaning Means nothing at all My dog licks my arm During tonight's thunderstorm With her eyes closed shut Stand up for yourself You're your greatest advocate Fighting warrior Attention drifting I tell myself to focus Don't like statistics In the shadows dark The joker is listening Take care how you speak Yo no, entiendo Learnt that for my Cuban trip Then got overcharged Imagine my shock The blood all left my body Where could it have gone? A torrent of thought Spikes the banks of consciousness Washing life away Why is no one here? In a room full of people Someone listen up Restless eyes open Dark light fills the void with ease Dreams are not promised Blinding white moonlight The red figure stands proudly While the eyes still gaze Now I will be blunt Optimism's struggle cold All of it pointless Your words for me read Absent are your emotions Dreaming of presence Deading games outside Conversations over drinks Summer fun again Cool breeze in the night [whispers] drown out the ringing Restless without them You were invited Why did you leave so quickly? Loved you always You were nice to me When I had no faith in me I want to say thanks Music and daydreams So profound, I drown they end I am here again Tragedy, heartbreak Something we all encounter You will push through this Haikus in this sub Are a fun way to help me? Forget about you Place here, nature words Now for some descriptive words I wrote a haiku Dry rocks and boulders Bake under pitiless sun Where is the river? What does it mean when? I want nobody else but It hurts to be here Yesterday's Haiku Means nothing whatsoever No bridge, no water Whichever I pick Indica or Sativa Which star to shoot for? Darkened afternoon Warmer days, a memory Snow fluttering by To see it again Makes me warm, happy inside That sweet smile of yours YouTube video Glasses with his violin Will you love me too? This drunken evening I used you as a toilet Just a little joke Beauty in struggle The emotions of my past Listen to music I died in my sleep Somebody needs to tell me How I wake back up? Gang mentalities Explain their brutality 'To serve and protect' The virus rages A month later, and I still Can't catch my breath A cold winter's night Drifts by in the inky swirl There shines 'Silver Pearl' The United States Land of depressed, broken, scared After all, it's home Someone once told me Becoming the rose that grows in Between the concrete Wine tastes different If you take a sip alone Or among good friends? My dreams are full now Your color, your temperature Pressed behind my eyes Each dandelion We made wishes together I wished yours came true We are like microbes Zits and blackheads and pock marks On earth's graceful skin I want to die now Put a bullet in my skull Will I regret this? Link by link by link The Internet grows bigger Now it spans the globe Miles separate us Yet we're inseparable I know it will last Confession of love When seen as motivation? Becoming one of guilt Cell phone poetry [Rhythms] hiding in plain sight Time to call my mom The heat of the Scotch [Kennels] A warm memory To happier times Ah, the rain returns Beautiful morning to sleep But there are babies Found an open book Rosetta Stone unwritten Read between the lines Sleepless solitude Sleeping next to wrong person Both are lonely nights How do you expect? To find love in this time of Social distancing Refrigerator Homosexuality All the gays are cool I love who you are To me a light in darkness A joy in my world My heart palpatates All these people I don't know Watch me bare my soul Sundance through the blinds A lazy Sunday with you Pizza for breakfast Massive jaws stretched wide Gaping to consume the sun Screaming constantly Luke Skywalker dies Kylo Ren kills Master Snoke Princess Leia lives Death is the end, right? So why am I still awake? I feel everything Tell me when and where And for you, I will be there Twenty minutes late I'm new to Reddit This sub has piqued my interest It's pure poetry The golden hew fades Violet extending forth All encompassing From seed to the top Branchs all under the sun A pleasant shadow Your presence, my joy God's plan for you and Ilove So blessed are we all? Sitting here, I be Writing this haiku for you Trying to see Green Solitary thoughts Thinking of good times we had Face to the fall wind Today I have learned Split sentences unwelcome Still learning mercy As the time ticks by I mindlessly fill the void But still wait for you Like everything else Self awareness, it turns out Always relative Online piracy Not a crime without victims Hurrying creators At the long table When trying not to take sides The world turns below Humans aren't we all? Just pieces of the same leaf Leaves of the same tree I stumble to sleep On the soft stones of cartoons And padded voices These cold winter nights Speaking in whispers, they weep Turning the last page Lonesome streetlight glow Families stir in their homes America sleeps Got all my stuff moved Carried boxes all day long Oh, my achin'back Hometown memories Never forget where you're from Nostalgie and more This is the end part Here I'm adhered and not here Here we go again Anxious gardeners Hurl debris into calm lakes Turbulous waters Middle or upper Can't tell by looking at them They're the bourgeoisie The promise of flight Waiting in this concrete tomb Sticked at the airport Your hidden struggles How I pray in love for grace Please take my handwalk When life is clouded When we forget who we were How can we return? The world is so cool You can do a lot of things Yet somehow I don't One swipe to the right A chat, a coffee, a walk One kiss told me all A youthful car and Aging face with frazzled hair Rebelling the truth Coronavirus Firth, dry cough, maybe death Grab all the bog roll Bookends you and I A story of love between Lord, thank you so much Sticked in this prison Shackled by complacency Binded by laziness Sunshine, kiss the moon Wind chymes, rattle the window Eternally still Should I be dragged down? If my ball and chain are so So comfortable Understand your pain There is wisdom to be gained In rumination Solitary tree Ornaments of pink petals A black bird perches Before the virus Travel was an adventure Now it instills dread Removeds of your Existence spread around the Apartment we shared Always wanting more Time to get up and get it Today is the day Worldly joy tempts me At what cost brief is the high? Teach me Lord this day My eyes are heavy Sleep calls, but falls on deaf ears I must finish this Cocoon split apart Complete metamorphosis Butterfly takes flight I bare my sharp teeth The laughter emits through them The reason in front Trick or treaters come To a house without candy I left my lights on A weed edible It's not working, I need more I need ambulance Spring caterpiller My friend sitting on a leaf Soon you will have wings Words held within'Why? They are for you, for us now Today let's converse I always crave hugs They pull me in life's purpose The tight, warm embrace Puddle in the woods What an ugly sight in May? Moisterias rejoice I dislike most things However, cloudy blue skies Gives my cold heart wings Tick tick time flies by Many, but never enough Grace is all I need Thunder and lightning A big boom, a streak of light A storm from within Unexpected rain Her smile was my umbrella And then the sky cleared Why should time be killed? When you have nothing to do Why not simply live? Your head and your hands It's the'price of prescience' My dear cicero Lost in the snowstorm I feel warmth emanating A smoking chimney Endless solitude A smile as my pretty mask Hollow and empty Mother and baby Peaceful in their slumbering Coughed on the couch A hole in the ground A box with old memories A hole in the heart I'm alone again It's just begun to get cold The lake is frozen My mind is weary I dreamt of dolphins last night I was at last free No fear left inside Everyone wants to love you Free upon this wave Get out already You've been in there forever The longest shower In a nicer world There's no riddle take the grain Crossing the river Leaves falling floating Colours fading, cold returns Winter is coming [ clocks] No longer tick Time has no space when with you Universe free float Beckoning blue pool Summer's Master flatterer Relieves only sun Did you find it yet? I checked everywhere there too Oh, it's in my bag I leaned into you I thought you were solid ground I am in pieces The sun shines longer Crocuses, push back the dirt Ospreys divebomb fish She has a berry Can be gulped down easily Monsters ate my wife A weathered headstone Here lies a polititian Their last honest words Can't take it with you Golden coins fall through fingers Summer's wealth is spent We wait for summer Winter wears and wears us down We settle for spring When making friends with Buddhists don't get too attached They certainly won't Voluptuous lips Stamped red by sweet strawberries Meet mine so softly If there is a god She probably hates us for Calling her father Fall in love again She's at the Chinese buffet Hope she likes her food A bright, sunny day Thankful for the warm weather Blue sky, puffy clouds Running in circles Channing with no end in sight The tail was my own Salted bone feathers Darting salmon now on bloom Rain buckets too soft She is a princess So beautiful, what a trip? She came from my dreams Silent halls echo [Claires and whistles] And clapping The basketball drops This is my rifle There are many like it, but This rifle is mine Love was all you knew Tail wags never seemed to stop A very good boy Sitting in a bush Up down, up down, push, push push Busted on her, tush Seem through dusty blinds One lark perched on a wet branch Morning light rising I bear a great weight It is not anxiety It is loneliness Why do you do it? Searching for the real you by Running all your life No color, the same Yet under the moon and stars We all wear midnight To find a purpose Is a thing one cannot do? The purpose finds you I woke up today I looked over and saw you I felt myself smile The silence is heard Irrevocably noticed A screech owl breaks it I made a mistake And you forgave me for it Let us celebrate hoped you wanted me But then I remembered that You wanted him more? He is a warm mass With Gentel Snores that calm me Envelop me sleep Singing songs gently Assuredly out of tune Words I never knew I got out of bed Small but monumental task One day at a time Fourth floor balcony Minimal men beneath Run pointless errands Fingers, swipe pixels With heads bowed in piety Techno, Rosary Play ball with the dog Don't take it back, only throw He won't come in now My brain hurts like hell I should see a doctor now Oops, it is too late Perfect is your love Why don't I rejoice daily? I need a hug, Lord The great Phil Lynott May your memory remain? Within the black rose Under your shirt The skin of your back is cool As we sneak a kiss I think not of joy Love circles like a vulture Pain has company Oh, I miss watching Your body glide through the world A most perfect waltz Thankful happyhearts Staying healthy together Vaccin day for us I found a body Eyes staring through the dumpster Her face is my own Memory etched skin Angry ravines of self hate Those were sadder times Naught but a sliver The unspeakable Anguish The hidden splinter I'm covered in spikes Leave me alone, don't touch me Just please go away Are you gonna cry? Are you gonna piss your pants? Gonna shit and cum Go to Instagram Everyone cooler than me I am a loser Hey, I get it now He said too late for action To an empty room The music maker Enamored by the dancer Two beats synchronized A dance of moonbeams Reflections of soulful depth Internal sparkle I might be racist Racist to the human race You all fucking suck Hearts are made of glass I'm picking up the pieces I bled out for you (sigh) Missing the mark Knowing and choosing wrongly Today, a new start Inner flames drive me Yet she took my breath away What is even left? Fuck you, you fucking Fuck, I fucking fuck the fuck Out of your asshole This hand can't be mine Hurrys when I write draw or dream It's getting older Out on the islands Is a cool old crib stone bridge? And lobster boats too Laurent or yanny Polarised opinions A blue and white dress Walking past the park Green buds spring from naked trees Unbuttoned wool coats Still water, calm mind Mountains stand strong against waves Water finds a place I know you judged me The moment that you met me Take another look A porcelain face Cupid's astral arrow strikes And leaves me bleeding Starved without hunger Unmotivated, I wept Totally inept I should go outside But I let the day slip by Thinking not doing Unending boredom Searching for the answers in My fridge and my phone The white morning moon Casts subtle springtime shadows Beleuchtung Seasonal sadness Unrequited love once more Can't shake the feelings I sometimes wonder Do trees feel your heart beating? Touching their rough skin The stereos blare Wailing auditory waste Poison is toxic Silence implies end But leaves ambiguity Where a hope smoulders? Always had my back Even when I fucked up bad Love you, mom and dad Winter woods in spring Radiant space hung in time What will set it free? Living is calmness Energy a currency I am fond of both Your love gives me life Joy in serving you, my friends Let us dance and sing Looking for Haiku Written by Ikkyu, please help Classical Chinese Playing in the mud At a leaky faucet, the Wasp is rolling pies Turn on tune in, drop LSD with Tim Leary Mind expanded, yes Should my haiku rhyme? I learn new things all the time But my rhyming sucks Procrastination Keeping me under my sheets A tranquil delay Cold winter mornings Swans napping on the river Make my feet feel cold All things fall apart Yet I continue to hope I'm an idiot Looking at my face The crevices to show for Living sixty years First, I beat my meat Then I yeet my skeet always That is my motto Jesusglorious Jesusforgiving, my sins Jesus,lead me, Lord Covid means caring For others and yourself too So wear a damn mask Put the kettle on Life is short, there's lots to do Better get to work Flowers, Bob their heads People hurry to shelter Birds flit in spring rain Strictles should do it Do you think they're sharp enough? Might just take a few A soft white feather Floating toward a hard ground My hand captures it With each new haiku I find I am compelled to Count each syllable A vision long gone Is that what the future holds? A silly daydream Barrows of light strike down The sky yells and cries enraged My candle flickers Same old resting pond Soft breeze, kissing the surface Goose bumps spreading out My roommate is black I'm a really big brown boi Diversity is These words like riddles Filling your mind and the room With silent questions The Florida man Is making headlines again? What has he done now? And the curtains close On life, death and the beyond A wonderful show I heard something said I then lost myself to it I do forgive you Brought back from the brink Death is peaceful, nothingness I want to go back First, it's snow, then green Violets and reds, then gold Then brown, then the snow Nature gave a push Giving birth to October In a cry of cold Off rocks, Ricciochet Sharp calls of the birds above Do they hear us, too? An ember ignites That which they thought could not burn My world turns crimson Sit back and relax Then without warning a tug A beautiful koi Their screaming voices Echo down the corridors Silence them, but how? If only I could Unsee a film unhear a Song you'd be long gone Salt shooter, then lime See how many you can take Then puke your guts out A boy and a girl Holding hand in the night sky Eternal romance Say your goodbyes now Background noise of the new day Will soon drown you out Winds will come and go Sometimes bringing cloud or rain Change is natural You fit into me Like a key fits in a lock You open my heart Seriously, oh, no I treat them like a bad joke Haikus are so neat Young girls in their teens Arguing with each other Over boy, love books Accumulate wealth Think only of yourself since Gagne's not good, but God I threw a coin down In a wishing well today The coin sunk so low Finding work to do Ungratifying again Tomorrow, Beckons Time and time again You lead me to joy and peace I choose to follow In Halcyon days We used to run with the wolves Now we work for dogs Save the young So that they might understand We went through the same Choose to love no cost Persecution, temptation Trust, hope found in love An inner struggle Fighting many bouts with doubts Frequent opponent Good morning, sunshine Things are getting out of hand Breath, pull yourself up My cynicism Vs a tab of acid With no survivors Electricity Beefheart growls from pink deserts Miss Zeta, taketh From before my time Great music, words that inspire Miss you, Tony Sly They told me be vague Don't stand out or speek my mind Keep it all inside A country hook up No map is reliable I am surely lost Under two bluejays While digging in my garden I found a haiku I sat beside you Sharing thoughts, love exchanged joy Pilgrim's hand in hand Leave me misery I let you into my heart The pain lingers on My mind is a cage With thoughts endlessly swirling Is there no escape? The wind and the rain Stripping paint off toy soldiers The sky shoots to kill Is love anything? But basic reproduction Spelling continues Distractions, dart by Like a starved hound I pursue As time escapes me Hey, we need to talk Are you breaking up with me? This is how it ends Dishided by her, Shawl But the zodiac tattoo Swam over the breach Once upon a time In a shoe, she called her home Lived an old woman The speed of darkness Equal to the speed of light One master, one slave We crossed paths today Mask and hat left me unsure I hesitated Her hair is graying Crow's feet appear by her eyes Where has the time gone? Searching for presents? This side of Christmas Winter I don't hate you yet Brimming rays of sun Waiting to delve into the Corporeal soul Soft rain on the wind Beautiful and meaningless A sharp knife brings peace My book is published On Amazon now, but my Marketing does suck 'He was a good man' They all greeted me today Untrue, I'm just dead Swimming through darkness Searching for my one lost star Just out of my reach A pool of blank ink I want to dive into it Leaving lines behind? The cat is hungry A predator stalking prey The mouse becomes food Little white wires This ruffled patch of iron Stops my metal heart My daughter hates me I brought her into this world But I gave her up Yun and Yang exist But not absolute values Not so black and white The early morning Perfect peace in the twilight Just tranquility As peaceful as snow A quiet sense of true bliss After we made love Procrastination You want to change that habbit? Sooner or later An outdoor market Spicy fruit, fish, meat and wine The girl was stared at Got a coke balloon I just moved to a new house Lonley, journey tho A newborn rain drop Breaking its tiny body Against the hard ground Breaking point on Verge Cracks showing pressure building Sooner than later They said I'd lose fear After diving open sky Where planes and God play? Math homework must do Anxiety crawling in I might need some help When my assailant? Took only one ten pound note Was that his conscience? You did not forget Life lessons of love learned well Given to me, thanks Pretty little sheep Just wants to show off her dress It looks nice on you Neighbour clouds migrate The last sounds of nature sing Life yields fruit once more Don't cry in your soup Report the post or modmail Hissy fits are bad Baldness in Mirror A cascade of hairs fall down At the barber's floor Tupac spoke to me I lie, controversy sells A clouded judgement Words dance like ribbons Ephemeral candled ghosts Painted cavern walls This will be over When I'm so spent I collapse Just drag me away Now watching one piece Alabama episodes Winding down the night Even salted Earth Dressed under blankets of snow Can be beautiful Wild Bird, you teach me To hold out my open hand But not expect you Clouds saluting me As I fly away from home With my onion wings The ocean collects Memories unforgotten Keeped in her dark heart My dad was a clown I'm gonna be a clown too It's big shoes to fill Yo jack in the box The spicy popcorn chicken Fuckin slaps so hard Scenes once filled with life Now declining and fading Lord, constant your light As birds fall silent The East Wind becomes stronger Words change to whispers A selfish depart The grass is always greener Was this a mistake? I return to you The nose hair you plucked and flicked You thought no one saw Once again on app To find one to sit on lap Sadly, I look crap Calm waters, calm mind Darkness fades in brilliant light We rise together Past the swaying oak A traveling peony Guided by the stars After springtime rain Beautiful flowers sprout up Brilliantly blooming Everlasting life Transforming above the cloud Password protected You knew everything Transtransent presence of bliss Did you have to go? I could leave my mark Anywhere in this city? But I choose this van As it envelops Carnivorous fog whispers Deplete the light Hello, mother moon The tide swells at your behest Sleep well in your glow My master calls me Electronic sound commands My shiny smartphone What we want often? Won't reflect reality Sadly, this is life Spended my day alone Again, I think about you Until tomorrow Gentle, thoughtful care As Dawn breaks, so will she, too? Wages nursed in the dark Like two ships adrift Somehow we found each other And saw the sunrise When your world goes gray I will pinch your cheeks until The red absolves you Death will soon take you And all of the ones you love inevitably To define myself Ordinary ideas In abstract love The gold sands of time Through delicate glass, they fall Unique fall for all What is learned and made? revealing meaning in life For humanity A crow caws softer A Hummingbird monkey bars Haunted Dreams swingset When effort leaves you? The way envelops all life The current is swift I envy you, thief The moon must be delicious Judging by your grin The wind ripples clouds On the waters, glassy face A duck chases bread Trying times, my friends Let contentedness sooth you Simple values, true Together we hold With steel balls and diamond hands Strugging for the moon? To women's Libbers Don't strive for equality Achieve to be greater Now tipped upside down A single grain a moment The sands of time flow Blankets on the ground Staring up at satellites Summer writes itself A sapphire orb It's frosted to perfection I love blueberries Under the night sky Golden embers, giving warmth Marshmallows are burnt Laying on your back Under the glowing green Summer luxury Friday, the thirteenth Not a good day for most folks Superstitious swine To heal my spirit I must meditate at dawn God give me the strength The summertime jazz Like salsa through sinuses Opens up spirits Last few nights in town Freedom from a draining clock No holding back now I received your love How short was the time we shared? Till we meet again I fight for my right And I live for the thrillers Just not all the time President Moron How could it have come to this? Vote in November Moisterias are huge I feel like a blood donor I need to lay down Fog rolls through my mind Sluggishly, I move about A long day ahead I spotted a bird It derailed my train of thought I failed my classes Breezy is nudging Conifer conversations [whispering to sky] In dark, we make light In silence, we can make sound In this world poems She screamed out, oh, God I know she an atheist She must not hate this Strict hill before us Friends together, we will climb God guides and provides Marooned on an isle With no chance of a rescue His heart ached for her Pushed out of the nest Now, realizing I can fly Thank you for leaving You loved my green eyes Like a walk in the forest Now lost forever Prance delightfully Then give me aids mightily Male Ballerinas Darkness unfolding Plaques and tangles spreading wide Loved ones lose their minds Bright summer sunshine I own this day so divine My choices are mine [aches to give you up] Fly with your beautiful wings You were never mine As I receive praise I grant myself confidence Yet remain humble A youthful car, but Aging face with frazzled hair Rebelling the truth Lying on her side Book in hand, she scans the page Then turns to face me The first cup of tea Dusting away the cobwebs Waking up my mind Neighbour and worry Permeate my thoughts today Though not productive I am in charge here I volunteered for this job Please listen to me Beginning to end Inevitable at hand Life goes on, death comes shattered river ice Sews itself back together Scars, replace her breasts Times shared remembered Handing you to God's embrace [Friend] Thanks for your love I find it freeing The constraints of the format Elimits waste Out into the woods A man searching for meaning Finds only himself Just get me to work You need new brakes, yes, I know Cold cold car, please start Unhindered carefree Sang the birds, their joyful songs Despite the cold rain Raindrops are falling God is crying all night long Face hidden by clouds We were enemies The pain brought us together How are we so close? Tattoo studio The talented artist works A new butterfly Ink washing out blood Spirit stronger than the flesh But not all survive Humid city nights Continually shuffling Of feet on asphalt If I am a tree But your love is with the sea Make a ship of me Is spring not just an? Erawakening of the Earth From the deepest dream A crow flew upwards Camouflaged in the dark clouds Thinking thunder song? Give your meat a tug Put it between some nice buns Enjoy some pulled pork You do not fear death Perhaps you are ignorant Enlighten yourself Today's endless joy Chosed to be a slow runner Rather than a slug Spineing in circles? Attempting to get things done Making easy hard Golden, fall the leaves May the sun shine on your path? And farewell, she said Purrs vibrate my chest Mr Rogers needs my warmth Human space heater A cascade of light Sun beams peering through the clouds Reminds of hope Once upon a time At the end of a rainbow Miles found a trumpet Rains bring pains again But old scars will fade from skin You are a good friend I just can't escape Trust me when I say I've tried I won't forget you There is another Besides you in the fire You stand together All alone, pitch black In my bed, the thoughts evolve Fiending for resolve Pitch black and eerie Through the window, silent night But eyes stare both ways Sweet dreams, beckon me But racing thoughts keep me chained So I can't follow The icy wind blows So much coldness towards me Can't react in kind Beautiful flowers Clever winds blow them away Swiftly, life proceeds I had a dream once Joy, sorrow, triumph and loss Turns out it was life I miss that feeling Before you knew who I was Can we just go back? Two longing hearts met Remembering past lives lived? The two became one What are the chances? Such as my circumstances I need the answers Some insomnia I can dream my days away And worry through nights Night has calmed the heat Shining moon guards the sky path Ghosts stir anxiously I'll never forget Running my hands through your hair While you look at me You were everything I shut you off, I'm sorry Sunrise in her eyes The secrets you share Shall soon return to shame you? Trust no one, my friends Earth and sky melded The binding that calls down rain Petrichor smell'd it? My heart beats faster Your sweet smile brightens my day When you pass by me The feeling has changed From a sinkhole to a cave A radiant void Freedom is not free Through fall, frost and spring, we fought Summer will return The patter of rain Groes of wind blow through my room Free for the moment Plastic and gases Unnatural minerals Planet consumers Somewhere in the world Someone is building a chair Someone else is dead I miss you, but I Don't miss you, I love you still But I don't like you No time left to spare Through an isolating time Silent they suffer Use efficient words Seven syllables go here Five for first and last Steel Mountain Skyline Red lights flicker and twinkle Living city streets This girl is thirsty And it's starting to show this Is not a good look Fighting don't resolve Do not fight in life ever Love, live, do not hate Drop falls after drop Reading the tracks of your tears Parallel poems Planes and trains arrive An agreement yet to come High road untraveled I am full of hate Hot yearning for things to end Let's kill each other To you everything Is a spider leg broken? Off above the knee Upon the ocean I labour for my future One day it will come Withered flowers cry Ringing ears distract the mind Asphyxiation Trouts are a signal They explain how far you reach Deep into my chest See what's looking back A welcome escape from all Wash the fear away I throw the dog's ball In the Lanzana bush Peapers everywhere Stark, cold, gray hallway Body bags are near the morgue But one starts to move An ecosystem As vast as the Amazon In a box outside Stringing pretty lights Their phosphorescent flash is Christmas in July I've diabetes That's not cash money of life I've shidded my pants Like hidden termites We only see their progress When the house falls down From where comes the nerve? Hey, you can you stay inside? Help flatten the curve July, sixty nine Curious moths and street lamps Armstrong on the moon A yawing freighter Rocking, starboard and port is Bowing down to sleep I know just enough To know that I don't know much Except I love you The bent willow tree She's its leaves into the stream Why are you weeping? Morning espresso Accelerating the mind And bowel alike Not so serious Exhaustive efforts fail Be like the water Haikus are easy You just have to say some things And count how many Eyes start to water Impending sneeze, incoming I hate allergies The angel's cold tears Calls for the land's protector But no one answers I'm very hungry But am having too much fun Video games starve Exam tomorrow Anxiety rolling in Paralyzing me Focus clarity Daily, my view is improved Such hints of wonder A warm lambent glow Peaking through shadowy bush A new day to come Sensing five fingers Each open understanding Xenial right now You are wearing me Out like a fashion statement Affection is en Vogue Salt stains on suede shoes Swallows soaked by soggy snow Winter's welcome, wanes Somewhere over the Rainbow way up high there's A Land that I've heard of My cat weighed two stone The humming birds, remember? The branches she reached All the world's a stage implying I have a part But I have no script How do people still? Make original haikus You'd think we'd run out Called to follow you Eyes on you is all it takes All else fades away The day continued With no care of how I felt My soul slowly died The thirst is the worst When the sun fell down at last I drank water first How many hipsters? To change a lightbulb, it's a Small, obscure number He did lose his aunt Does he see me as his friend? I care about him Sharks are swimming in An ocean of snow by his Dorsal fins of ice On a pale spring day One rhinoceros beetle Feasting on fig tarts A cold wintry night Be overcome by warm morning With mighty purpose Midnight still awake While the rest of the house sleeps I dread tomorrow Don't paint the rainbow It's colors are everywhere Experience it Vibrations meet sand The grains dance accordingly Illustration sound God's hand see it now Reach out, connect, rise with joy Always there for you Suching fellowship? As hard as it may become Destiny awaits A tale of brothers Saving people hunting things Natural draped in his own flag The war removed everything Finally, he's home destined to descend Leaving a path of silver? Usher of winter One billion flashlights Shine down from the winter sky Ongoing tents I found you wilting Damn the sun, I will hide you But come back to life You can see the scars Where the sharp words cut this line? In three pieces Swift fat drops of rain [Compliring] Summer's end As autumn begins The park weekday nights Kids and dogs trample wet grass Last day's of summer Easy, wounded He sits and waits for something That will never come I can't miss ever I'm the motherfucking man I will never miss In blueberry woods Yellow raincoat, purple tongue I breathe in the rain It was destiny Ship was born to die in sea Won't forget you, Jack Water is dripping Echoing into a pan Driving me crazy Castles in the sky Above blue ridge sentinels Bathed in golden hues They say make a wish Upon the first twilight star Already have you Lunch break, walks fill me The flowers and dogs and kids Alas, I head back The ice has melted Everywhere that I can see Except my garden Why yes, I believe That it was Satan in me Gave me eyes to see If you are alone Just remember this haiku And I'm there with you And to what extent? Will these ceaseless dreams be lived? We all are waiting I love you for real Always know this love is real Because I am here When a good friend leaves A piece of them still remains Forever with you My ass is heavy It feels like anvil with legs My ass really hurts Sometimes I feel it This my city of angels Is my only friend? It comes once a year So celebrate with a pie It's three point one four I am in great pain Flashed before me a good life I am now at peace I got high off your Futes and chemicals and I Took too much too much Cthulhu sees all Death and destruction shall come He can not be stopped Drink before you drive Things can go south really fast Be careful, okay? Living with regret Keep wishing I could go back I should have kissed you You appear charming And careless, but I know the Chaos that you hide Silently, she sings A song of serene sadness But she's just a rock An early snowfall Drains warmth from the flower pot Cat curls up in bed Five, seven and five I could never count that well Why all that damn math? Brocaded clouds are From the House of Autumn and Dress a purple sky Through thick and thin friends There for you, no matter what? I thought I had two Insolence pervades So reprimand my buttocks Don't spare the Rattan All up in yo'house With my feet upon the couch eff yo' couch biotch To discourage mice The kitchen is kept well cleaned Such orderliness Calm and balanced thought Harmony follows the plot Good actor of life Dawn drips on the trees Rambos of black meet the eye Wind breathes relieved, sigh How hard can it be? To string some words together And call it Haiku A sudden rush of Euphoria, the fleeting Runner's High is here I look in your eyes And find my gaze drifting down Where your lips await? Don't let me say this I love you for all you are Heart, soul, hands and smile The fog lingers low Dimming the colours of life A monochrome cloak She tracks her gray ghost Footprints she believes too much And I too little Radiant fuzz ball Bursts to thousands with the wind Parachutes descend Today I'm alone Tomorrow I have to work Though just as alone Displaying patience The spider waits for its prey Death gives way to life Life is fleeting fast Memories slip as time flies Live with no regrets Today, a setback Your pain permeates my thoughts Why this path, my Lord? The dough has risen And soon the oven will yield A warm loaf of bread Chicken, bacon ranch Oh, that adds up to seven Would ya look at that? Walls, can you hear me? The trees weren't talking either Everyone hates me Dead humming meadow Thinky vines constrict the oak Falls down the soldier I would love to know What a hot pocket tastes like? Without a burnt tongue Face through misty glass Who is it a bell chimes back? Crimson specks in snow We could never be You were just a dream and I Was your fantasy? Maybe I'm a ghost I hope we can spend more time Does it hurt so fine? This sweet little hate Is but a fleeting feeling Gitter burns within us Anthonize matters Say it in Canadian It's Montessori The nights grow shorter Yet I remain in darkness Please turn the light on Moving furniture Kills me as I save money Wawa overdose? Creative lifetime Now artifacts circulate We make just to share Once again, such pain Slows me down, but I endure Offered up for you Atrium is full Aggressively shitting birds A ruined new hat A man with no shoes Met a man who had no feet And he was humbled The Earth is dying We're only getting older Listen to your heart The tide washes out Memories of us both here Tracks gone from the sand Pain inside my chest Another one down the hatch Crying out to God Chating on my phone Like I have nothing to do But to talk with you I must clean my room My cellphone beckons to me Scroll and see and like Faith hidden within Listenhear, looksee, believe He does it for you Been more then a year Everyone says to move on I fucking miss you anniversaries Today makes fifteen for us That's Sixty Seasons Saw you in a dream And said we really have to Stop meeting like this There are things I knew But I no longer know them Brain leaks still not fixed Where is my haiku? I know I posted it here Oh, look six upvotes Don't fuck with someone Other's feelings because you're Unsure about yours My poop smells awful I should go to the doctor Or stop eating eggs Share meeple castles Creative seven letters Always pick tiles first Did you guys know that? Reddit has a haiku bot It must love this sub Cornucopias Thin white vertical incense First, honeysuckles I notice the heat A lonely light flickering Surviving the night? Everything is black I just want to be happy It will never be Life weighs heavy A Long way ahead, steep, it goes Yet it glows golden Ushua World Limits Unwillily bound to earth Yearning for the stars Invisible strings Are attached to all of us And all tangled up Haikus, help me think Momentary, concise thoughts Stopped with a ribbon Clouds shredded by wind Wet feet for man in the moon Willows still weeping An otter went down In the glassy water To catch her breakfast Do not waste your time And know that without failure You cannot improve Beating my way back Another night on this road I gaze at the moon Keep this in your mind Only after the clouds cry, Will the rainbow come? Gazing at the moon On a still summer's evening Feast for mosquitoes Old brittle dry bones Found inside a uniform A past imperfect She cries silently Her sobs barely audible And no one to hear There's a pelican In that ball of feathers, Tar Or it is a gull Looking for something In the bottom of a cup The low autumn sun Middle of the night My fingers tick tick ticking A hot flash, Haiku Kissing the widow Along her silver neck chain The glint of his ring My Ford Explorer On a neverending quest For a parking spot I saw that finger Yes, you in the intrepid We shall meet again Flush to the sunrise Old Donkey taking winter One day at a time In the nursing home She talks about the brother No one talks about Peapers in the wind My neighbors practice Tai Chi In the parking lot Cool and cloudy day Slowly, the season changes Remirrored in your eyes Lights of the ferry Leave the island of Cedars In deep dark shadow Tonight on my deck Setting sun the longest time Bring memories back Sultry July day A homeless fans herself with A piece of cardboard Morning cloudy sky She comes out of the shower Wrapped in a towel Saturday night rain A couple eye the lobsters In a water tank Snow mixes with rain My mother keeps calling me By my brother's name Fog on the mountain Rain tapping the window pane Cup of tea steaming Picking up his toys Still in my funeral clothes The very last time Lullaby of rain Another pinch of saffron In the pumpkin soup Concert in full flow Mingling with the music The smell of cooking Sensinels of spring Kite's bobbing for attention In saucy, March winds Read the lunation What it says about winter? Then perfect the step The crayoned rainbow Got swallowed by her sea bed Sinking deep inside Turkey, chicken, duck (Sourcings, ham, bacon pie) Sizzle on salvers Stars wishing upon The potential of humans Shine faithfully on Collect red bug bites Show you a peacock before His tail gets ratty Do we seem rootless? Holding fast to the anchor Of the saddest things Old man's love affair In trying to forget it A winter rainfall Silence of the Dawn Sewing in sun speckled sea Gliding into port Tango with shadows Each on its own axis spins Dialogue of light Shadow and pollen Atop mauve crocus petals Bespeak winter's end Dying of the leaves Forest of changing colours Silence of the trees At sunset we sat You and me quietly there Breathing in and out To find the beauty Even if it's dark and grey That lightens my day My mother told me That a yellow sunset means Hard wind is coming Long shadows at noon Means winter and sun cold day Of peaceful walking Like a summer breeze Blue sky landing in my heart A cloud with feathers Corner of my eye Perception is blurry line Between truth and lie Happy to be here Sparrow says good morning day In the golden light Rest your weary feet Comfortable place to sit and eat The squirrel settle Alchemy of light Turning moments into gold Everywhere I look Dawn and dusk cycle Another tree has fallen Now rests silently Shadows of my life Walking closer or away I'm still no closer Got just a dusting Snow heavier south of here It's still very cold A moment, Rustle In the grasses of the fields Spring is leaving us Maple lights in wood Like stars of nature's heaven Pursuing the earth Autumn sunrays shine On forest trees soon to sleep Colored shadows weep Night Sunset in Wales ancestors of this landscape Gazed upon this scene Autumn sunshine glows On nature's sparkling jewels Colours of heaven Before the red gate Only one choice to be made Enter or escape Swans rest together In the evening, star sunset Until darkness falls No bunch of flowers Only this magnolia bud I do not forget By the jetty waits A silver boat for sailing On water, so blue Clouds at sunset time Hide the dying gold sun rays Shine as magic lights Memories so pure Life that was so beautiful Colours of sunset Only the one now Hold on tight and remember Protect and cherish Rising from the earth Space like vision of beauty Treasure of plantlife A perchance to dream Hear singing of the sea birds Boats bobbing on tide Ponies on the sand Summer evenings will soon end Racing to the sea Sundance fading fast Seagulls resting on the sands Time for going home Only the gold sun Setting over the Welsh Sea Simmering like silk In this autumn, morn Rusty reflections of trees Gliding of the Swans Copper medals shine Nature's prizes for beauty In magic beech leaves Colours of jewels Amber, Ruby, Gold, Silver Painted on the lake Flash of a rainbow Jewels of ruby and gold Nature's raw beauty Wild ponies of Wales ancestors of the high hills Rooted in this place Low sunrays shining Golden Sunset, Magic Time Long winter shadows Silver dancer sways Slender branches blow in wind Sacrifice tree of old Seven hundred years The Abbey walls have listened In prayer and silence Reaching to the sky Beauty in its silent grace Protecting the graves Watching the ponies Standing in the warm sunshine Moments of beauty Blue sapphire sky Silver Jewelled, sparkling sea Summer at the beach Feathers of soft silk Colours of clouds in the sky Silence of the Swans By box pond, Foxgloves Light up shadows in the woods Trees softly whisper Meet at the arbour Looking over green woodlands To distant landscape A magical scene Dragonfly in summer sun In an insect world When shadows begin To eat the light at sunset Darkness will swallow Such a handy bridge For crossing tiny puddles Of left over rain The sound of tadpoles Singing that late winter day Curated my winter blues Shadows fall around Announcing a cloudy day The sun is hiding I took time today To watch the sun slowly fall In dark of night The sky went crazy Blue and white mixed together Like a bowl of soup The snowman held on Getting smaller and smaller Refusering to melt Can women eat here? Not according to the sign Photo may be cropped A crossing of lights A pair of bold, bright colors Does X mark the spot? Will any name work? For this fragile piece of art Call it beautiful Sunshades and water The perfect mix for a day Of lounging around Here's a lone building Here's a long lonely landscape Where are the people? Heaven surely waits For one so surrounded by A lifetime of love What catches the eye? The angle of light on stairs Shows the way to go My initial thought Like a yellow submarine What goes on inside? The message folded In the shutters was the Mystery that day A glimpse of branches Amidst the concrete and steel Walk slower and see See the lemon slice So cool and casual near The frosty glasses Explosion of lights Could be almost anything Except sheer darkness Vibrational neon blue A reflection of the sky In many windows Ghostly figures, dance Beyond the broken windows Beg for attention New Mexican spring Observing on both sides of Screen as expected The placid pastel Saint presides over her world Always gazing up In those very last Days before spring's arrival Nothing was yet green The Carnival Ride Had a bit of a stutter Glad I was grounded No words can enhance The South Pacific night time [Skypes] Why even try? Eerie glow from night Divers undulates through the Clear ocean water The day breaks gently This close to the equator Day's nights are equal soaking in Mozart A purple cactus flower On the windowsill Cupidal snug plays Solitaire eats like you would Load a pellet gun A sunflower field Millions of tiny faces Slighting in daylight Good night, fair city Your belly button sex drive Makes me fucking sick Not willing to leave This imperfect nest, this bird Has so much to learn The clouds open up A halo of rain downpour Your lips glistening Another new year The reek of gunpowder wafts On the cold night air The Vermillion glow From the pistachio trees I knew your father Rain turning to snow A beggar in the subway That no one believes Smell of sweet clover Sting into the place I used to belong Early winter moon The sound of a newspaper As it hits the ground The polished surface A white heron hesitates To put its foot down Before the curtain The drama of schoolgirls In the audience Sundance on the wall Brushing against the yellow My deep blue shadow In the parking lot A rose petal has arrived From nowhere special A great blue heron Wading through autumn colors One step at a time Not a laughing mouth A bent bow or an eyelash The slender new moon Under the red leaves The rungs of the fish ladder Silvered by Salmon You hardly know when You are coming back, you will Find so much to learn He digs the flowers Green, red and blue nor wishes To be spoken to He digs the flowers And cuts the hay and never Seems to want to play The Roses push their Little tendrils up and climb Higher and higher Paul's head was heavy His hands obeyed no orders For his fancy strayed Goddess of morning Aurora, as friend of my Muse I once knew you Sorry, blazers, but The pelicans just want the Ball more than you do First week of classes And stress has already made It's right at home My uber drivers Backseat is full of glitter Who was the culprit?
